			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Project Infrastructure and Development Environment Setup",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this into subtasks covering: monorepo structure setup, Docker services configuration, TypeScript/tooling setup, environment validation, development scripts, CI/CD pipeline setup, and security scanning integration. Each should be independently testable.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to multiple infrastructure components that need coordination. Each technology stack (Docker, TypeScript, CI/CD) requires specialized knowledge and careful integration."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Event-Driven Architecture and Messaging Infrastructure",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: Kafka cluster deployment, Schema Registry setup, event schema design and implementation, producer/consumer base classes, Kafka Connect configuration, and event-sourcing patterns with exactly-once semantics.",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity due to distributed systems concepts, exactly-once semantics requirements, and the critical nature of the messaging backbone for the entire system."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Agent Framework and Monitoring Infrastructure",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: BaseAgent framework design, structured logging and tracing setup, Prometheus metrics implementation, ELK stack deployment, lifecycle management, circuit breaker patterns, and agent testing framework.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity requiring deep understanding of observability patterns, distributed systems monitoring, and framework design that will be used by all other agents."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "CreativeCompanion Agent and Ideation System",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: conversation memory system, multi-LLM provider integration, conversation state machine, idea generation algorithms, and real-time WebSocket implementation.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity involving AI integration, real-time communication, and stateful conversation management. Requires coordination between multiple LLM providers."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Content Generation Engine with MasterPlanner and ChapterWriter",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: MasterPlanner hierarchical planning, chapter template system, ChapterWriter with RAG implementation, content caching layer, batch processing with Celery, Prefect workflow orchestration, LangGraph agent coordination, and context management.",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity as this is the core content generation system requiring coordination of multiple AI agents, workflow orchestration, and sophisticated context management for long-form content."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Quality Control and Consistency Management System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: QualityCritic scoring system, rule-based evaluation metrics, LLM-based evaluation, ConsistencyGuard with knowledge graphs, semantic contradiction detection, and feedback loop implementation.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity requiring multiple evaluation approaches, graph database integration, and sophisticated NLP processing for consistency detection across large content volumes."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Vector Database and Semantic Consistency Engine",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: Milvus deployment and configuration, text embedding pipeline, vector collection design and indexing, semantic search API, and incremental indexing system.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to vector database operations, embedding pipeline optimization, and the need for efficient semantic search across large content collections."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "React Frontend Application with Modern UI/UX",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: React application setup with build tooling, state management implementation, component library creation, real-time features, rich text editor integration, PWA features, and accessibility implementation.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity involving modern React patterns, real-time collaboration features, and comprehensive UI/UX requirements including accessibility and offline capabilities."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "API Gateway and Authentication Services",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: FastAPI gateway setup, JWT authentication system, rate limiting implementation, request validation and error handling, and service discovery mechanism.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity involving standard backend patterns but requiring security best practices, rate limiting, and service coordination features."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Data Pipeline and Content Export System",
			"complexityScore": 6,
