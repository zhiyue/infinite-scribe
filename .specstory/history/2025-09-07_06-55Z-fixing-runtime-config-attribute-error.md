# Fixing runtime_config attribute error (2025-09-07 06:55Z)

_**User (2025-09-04 16:36Z)**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Cannot access attribute "runtime_config" for class "EventBridgeServiceFactory"
  Attribute "runtime_config" is unknown
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is showing me a small code snippet where they're trying to access `factory.runtime_config` on an `EventBridgeServiceFactory` instance, but they're getting an error that the attribute "runtime_config" is unknown.

Let me look at the related files to understand what's happening. I need to see:

1. The actual test file to understand the full context
2. The EventBridgeServiceFactory implementation
3. What `get_event_bridge_factory()` returns

Let me start by reading the test file and then the factory implementation.</details></think>

I need to see the actual implementation to understand the issue. Let me check the relevant files.

Could not find file '/home/zhiyue/workspace/mvp/infinite-scribe/apps/backend/tests/unit/services/eventbridge/test_integration.py' in the workspace.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I couldn't find the specific file or get results from semantic search. Let me try to find the files with grep search to locate the EventBridgeServiceFactory and related components.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I found the files related to EventBridgeServiceFactory. Now let me look at the actual implementation of the factory to understand what attributes it has.</details></think>

Read file: undefined

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I can see the issue! Looking at the `EventBridgeServiceFactory` class (lines 28-232), it doesn't have a `runtime_config` attribute. The factory has:

1. `settings` (line 45)
2. `eventbridge_config` (line 46) 

But no `runtime_config` attribute.

Now I need to find where `EventBridgeRuntimeConfig` is defined and what it should be accessing. Let me look for that.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Interesting, I can't find `EventBridgeRuntimeConfig` in the codebase. Let me look at what the factory actually has in terms of config properties. From the code I saw, it has `settings` and `eventbridge_config`. 

Based on the error message, the test is trying to access `factory.runtime_config`, but looking at the factory implementation, it should probably be accessing `factory.eventbridge_config` instead.

Let me also try to find the actual test file to see the full context.</details></think>

            <summary>Listed directory undefined • **0** results</summary>
        
No results found
</details>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I see there are several test files but none named `test_integration.py`. Let me check what could be the right attribute to access based on the factory implementation. From what I saw in the factory, it has:

1. `settings` - the general settings
2. `eventbridge_config` - specifically the EventBridge configuration

The error mentions trying to assert against `EventBridgeRuntimeConfig`, but I couldn't find this class in the codebase. The most likely solution is that the test should be accessing `factory.eventbridge_config` instead of `factory.runtime_config`.

Let me check what the eventbridge_config actually is by looking at the settings structure.</details></think>
