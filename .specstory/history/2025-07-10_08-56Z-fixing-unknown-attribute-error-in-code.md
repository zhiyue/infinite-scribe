# Fixing unknown attribute error in code (2025-07-10 08:56Z)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Cannot access attribute "ALLOWED_ORIGINS" for class "Settings"
  Attribute "ALLOWED_ORIGINS" is unknown
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is getting a linter error indicating that `settings.ALLOWED_ORIGINS` doesn't exist on the `Settings` class. Looking at the code in `apps/backend/src/api/main.py`, I can see:

```python
from src.core.config import settings
```

And then:

```python
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=settings.ALLOWED_ORIGINS,
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

The error suggests that the `Settings` class in `src.core.config` doesn't have an `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` attribute defined. I need to check what the settings configuration looks like, but since I don't have that file, I can infer that either:

1. The `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` attribute is missing from the Settings class
2. It's named differently
3. The configuration needs to be updated

Based on typical FastAPI/Pydantic settings patterns, I should suggest adding the missing attribute to the Settings class. Since this appears to be a CORS configuration for allowed origins, it should probably be a list of strings.

Let me provide a concise fix by adding the missing attribute to the settings configuration.</details></think>

The error occurs because the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` attribute is missing from your `Settings` class. You need to add it to your settings configuration.
