# Fixing Neo4jContainer admin_password error (2025-06-27 09:24Z)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Cannot access attribute "admin_password" for class "Neo4jContainer"
  Attribute "admin_password" is unknown
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is getting a linter error about `admin_password` not being available on the `Neo4jContainer` class. I need to check what the correct attribute name is for the Neo4j testcontainer's password.

Looking at the code, they're using `from testcontainers.neo4j import Neo4jContainer` and trying to access `neo4j.admin_password`. The linter is saying this attribute doesn't exist.

Let me check what the correct attribute name should be. From my knowledge of the testcontainers library, the Neo4j container might use a different attribute name. Common alternatives could be:
- `password` 
- `neo4j_password`
- `admin_password` (but this seems to be what's failing)

I should look up the correct attribute name for the Neo4j testcontainer. Let me search for information about the Neo4j testcontainer to see what the correct attribute is.</details></think>

Based on the search results, I can see the issue. The Python testcontainers Neo4j container uses different attribute names than the Java version. Let me search for more specific Python documentation.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Looking at the documentation for the Python testcontainers Neo4j container, I can see in the constructor signature that it takes parameters like `password` directly, not `admin_password`. 

From the documentation:

```python
_class_ Neo4jContainer(_image: str = 'neo4j:latest'_, _port: int = 7687_, _password: str | None = None_, _username: str | None = None_, _**kwargs_)¶
```

This shows that the Neo4j container constructor takes a `password` parameter, not `admin_password`. So in the code, instead of accessing `neo4j.admin_password`, it should be accessing the `password` attribute directly.

However, looking at the code again, it seems like they're setting up the container and then trying to access the password that was generated or set. Let me check if the Neo4j container has a specific attribute for accessing the password after the container is started.</details></think>

The fix is to use `password` instead of `admin_password`:

The fix is simple: change `neo4j.admin_password` to `neo4j.password`. The Python testcontainers Neo4j container uses the `password` attribute instead of `admin_password`.
