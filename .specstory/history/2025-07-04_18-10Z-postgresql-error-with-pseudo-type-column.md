<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing PostgreSQL error**

The user encountered an error while running a psql script at line 268, indicating that "most_common_vals" has a pseudo-type of anyarray. The script selects columns from pg_stats and is specifically for certain table names in the public schema. It seems that in PostgreSQL versions 14 or 15, "most_common_vals" may have changed type, affecting the indexing process. This error could stem from trying to produce output or using IPC within a function.
**Understanding the error with 'most_common_vals'**

I noticed the error message about 'most_common_vals' being a pseudo-type anyarray. This suggests an index creation attempt, which isn't allowed with that type. The error likely arises when executing a command like creating a materialized view or using COPY. I've tested this in PostgreSQL and learned that selecting 'most_common_vals' works, but it can't be used directly in a persistent table. To fix this, I can recommend casting 'most_common_vals' and 'most_common_freqs' to text or dropping these columns if they're not essential.
**Explaining the error with index creation**

If the script is creating index suggestions, it may not require those values. The 'anyarray' type can't be used as a column type or persisted directly; it’s only for function arguments. To save it, I need to cast it to text. I could convert those arrays using `array_to_string(most_common_vals, ',')`. The error likely occurs when trying to execute a query within a materialized view or during a COPY operation. Additionally, I might mention using `pg_stats_ext` for newer versions. Let's provide the explanation and solution clearly!</details></think>

`pg_stats.most_common_vals` (and its companion `most_common_freqs`) is declared in the system catalogs with the pseudo-type `anyarray`.  
`anyarray` can be *read* just fine in an ad-hoc `SELECT`, but it is not a legal data type for a table column, materialised view, copy‐out, etc.  
As soon as your script tries to persist that query result (e.g. with `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW … AS SELECT …`, `CREATE TABLE … AS`, or `COPY (…) TO …`) PostgreSQL stops and raises

    ERROR:  column "most_common_vals" has pseudo-type anyarray

because “pseudo-types” are only allowed inside functions.

Fix: cast those columns to a real type (usually `text`) or omit them.

Typical patch
-------------
/// excerpt from docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/10-indexes.sql
```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW pg_stats_snapshot AS
SELECT
    tablename,
    attname                        AS column_name,
    n_distinct,
    correlation,
    most_common_vals  ::text       AS most_common_vals,   -- ← cast
    most_common_freqs ::text       AS most_common_freqs   -- ← cast
FROM pg_stats
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
  AND tablename IN (
        'novels', 'chapters', 'chapter_versions', 'characters',
        'worldview_entries', 'story_arcs', 'reviews',
        'genesis_sessions', 'domain_events', 'command_inbox',
        'async_tasks', 'event_outbox', 'flow_resume_handles'
    )
ORDER BY tablename, attname;
```

Variants
1. If you only need the statistics and do **not** care about the actual value list/frequencies, just drop those two columns from the SELECT.
2. If you prefer a cleaner representation, turn the array into text yourself:

   ```sql
   array_to_string(most_common_vals, ',') AS most_common_vals
   ```

3. For JSON output:

   ```sql
   to_json(most_common_vals) AS most_common_vals
   ```

After casting (or removing) the `most_common_vals` / `most_common_freqs` columns your script will run without the `anyarray` error on every supported PostgreSQL version.
