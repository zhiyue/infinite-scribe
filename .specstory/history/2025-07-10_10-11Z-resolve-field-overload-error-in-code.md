# Resolve Field overload error in code (2025-07-10 10:11Z)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
No overloads for "Field" match the provided arguments
  Argument types: (EllipsisType, Literal['Email address'], Literal['user@example.com'])
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Looking at the error, it seems that the `Field` function from Pydantic is not accepting the `example` parameter in the way it's being used. This is likely because in Pydantic v2, the `example` parameter in `Field` was changed or deprecated in favor of using it in a different way.

In Pydantic v2, examples should be provided in the field definition differently. Let me check the current usage:

```python
email: EmailStr = Field(..., description="Email address", example="user@example.com")
```

The error suggests that `Field` doesn't have an overload that matches `(EllipsisType, Literal['Email address'], Literal['user@example.com'])`.

In Pydantic v2, the `example` parameter in `Field` was replaced with `examples` (plural), and it expects a list. Alternatively, you can use the model's `model_config` to set examples at the model level.

The fix would be to either:
1. Change `example` to `examples` and provide a list
2. Remove the `example` parameter if it's not needed
3. Use the model-level configuration for examples

Since this is just one field and the example is simple, the easiest fix would be to change `example` to `examples` and provide a list.</details></think>

The error occurs because in Pydantic v2, the `example` parameter in `Field` has been replaced with `examples` (plural) and expects a list.

**Fix:**

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The fix has been applied successfully. The change is from `example="user@example.com"` to `examples=["user@example.com"]` which is the correct syntax for Pydantic v2. This should resolve the linter error.</details></think>

The fix changes `example` to `examples` and wraps the value in a list, which is the correct syntax for Pydantic v2.
