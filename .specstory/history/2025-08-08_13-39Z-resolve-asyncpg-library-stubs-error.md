# Resolve asyncpg library stubs error (2025-08-08 13:39Z)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Skipping analyzing "asyncpg": module is installed, but missing library stubs or py.typed marker
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Identifying missing type hints**

I need to address the missing type hints or stubs for asyncpg. The linter error from mypy or Pylance indicates that it's complaining about missing type information. The file causing this issue is a Python script named `scripts/run_migrations.py`, and it's showing an error about the "asyncpg" module being installed but lacking library stubs. 

I should explore solutions, like installing stubs, but it seems "asyncpg" might not have types in typeshed, and I'm recalling there could be a third-party package like 'asyncpg-stubs,' but I need to verify.
**Exploring asyncpg type hints**

I'm searching my offline memory about 'asyncpg' and its typing support. The error indicates it might not have library stubs or a py.typed marker, which means it possibly doesn't ship with types. 

I have several options: I could add type ignores for the import, adjust the Pyright config to ignore that library, or use stubgen to create local stubs. For mypy, I could declare ignore_missing_imports in the configuration. I need to carefully consider these solutions to address the typing issue!
**Proposing fixes for asyncpg typing**

In my code project, I prefer using `pyrightconfig.json`. The user asked for concise fixes for missing type stubs for 'asyncpg.' 

So, I have three options to propose: 

1) The easiest solution is to ignore missing stubs for 'asyncpg'. For mypy, I’d create a `mypy.ini` file, while for Pyright, I'd use `pyrightconfig.json`.

2) I could also generate local stubs by running the stubgen command and configuring the tools to look into the 'typings' directory.

3) Lastly, I could check for a stub package, but proposing installation of possibly non-existent packages could be risky. For Pylance in VSCode, I could adjust the diagnostic settings too.
**Addressing linter errors with asyncpg**

I notice that the workspace includes a file called `scripts/development/dev.py`, which suggests they might be using mypy. There are linter errors, with a message saying "Skipping analyzing 'asyncpg': module is installed but missing library stubs or py.typed marker." It seems this is a typical Pyright message.

To address this, I should propose adding a `pyrightconfig.json` at the project root. A quick fix could be adding `# type: ignore[import]` or `# pyright: reportMissingTypeStubs=false` at the top of the file. There are different syntaxes for Pyright, and I'm trying to find the most concise solution here!
**Resolving asyncpg type stubs issue**

Pyright supports several comment directives like `# pyright: strict` for different type-checking modes. I can use `# type: ignore` for ignored lines, though it's essential to note that this will silence only specific errors without addressing underlying issues. The error I'm facing is about missing type stubs for 'asyncpg.' 

To resolve this, I propose adding a `pyrightconfig.json` file to adjust settings. I could also create stubs using the `stubgen` command or explore using Pyright's built-in features if available. Next, I should check for existing configuration files in the project directory.</details></think>

I'll quickly check whether your project already has a type checker config (pyright/mypy) to decide the cleanest fix, then apply the minimal change to silence the missing stubs warning or add local stubs.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Resolving linter errors**

I need to address the Pyright linter error indicating a missing library stubs or py.typed marker for 'asyncpg' in my script run_migrations.py. The error appears due to the import on line 11. The pyproject.toml file is located under apps/backend. I see a few possible solutions: I could add type stubs for asyncpg by installing a typeshed stub package. However, I'm uncertain if those stubs actually exist for asyncpg or if it has PEP 561 typing, especially since it historically didn’t include py.typed.
**Addressing type-checking issues**

The message about "missing library stubs or py.typed marker" from Pyright means it can't type-check that module because of configuration settings. To resolve this, I can silence the warning by adjusting the "reportMissingTypeStubs" in pyrightconfig.json to "none," "warning," or "information." Another option is to add a per-module ignore with `# type: ignore[reportMissingTypeStubs]`. However, a more thorough approach involves creating a local stub package to define the types directly. This way, I can ensure better type safety for asyncpg.
**Resolving missing configuration**

So, I found there’s no pyrightconfig.json at the root level, but there's a pyproject.toml in apps/backend. The script I’m working with is located at the root in scripts/run_migrations.py. The absence of a Pyright config means I’m stuck with default settings that are causing linting errors. To fix this with minimal changes, I can add a type ignore comment directly to the import line for asyncpg. I think I should suggest using: 

```python
import asyncpg  # type: ignore[reportMissingTypeStubs]
```

The try-except block isn't necessary since the ignore comment alone suffices.
**Proposing a minimal fix**

I’m looking at an alternative pattern for my import statements. If I use `typing.TYPE_CHECKING`, I can import asyncpg as `_asyncpg_types` just for type checking without a runtime overhead. However, since the code just calls `asyncpg.connect`, I can simply add an inline ignore comment on the import line instead. 

For a quick fix, I’ll suggest:

```python
import asyncpg  # type: ignore[reportMissingTypeStubs]
```

This keeps it concise and follows the user's request for minimal changes while addressing the linter error directly in `scripts/run_migrations.py`.
**Implementing the ignore comment**

I'll propose adding the inline ignore comment for the import statement:

```python
import asyncpg  # type: ignore[reportMissingTypeStubs]
```

Now, I should check other tools in the environment that use Pyright. But adding this comment should be sufficient for fixing the linter error. Next, I’ll implement this change in `scripts/run_migrations.py` at line 11 using `apply_patch`, ensuring I preserve the existing indentation and line endings. Once that’s done, I’ll run `read_lints` to confirm the linter error has been cleared, passing the file as an argument. Time to proceed!</details></think>

I’m going to suppress the missing-stubs warning for `asyncpg` with a minimal, targeted change on the import line, then re-check lints for `scripts/run_migrations.py`.
