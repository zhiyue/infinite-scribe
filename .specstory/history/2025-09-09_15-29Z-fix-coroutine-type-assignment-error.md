# Fix coroutine type assignment error (2025-09-09 15:29Z)

_**User (2025-09-04 16:36Z)**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Argument of type "CoroutineType[Any, Any, AsyncConnection]" cannot be assigned to parameter "conn" of type "AsyncConnection" in function "_truncate_all_tables_via_conn"
  "CoroutineType[Any, Any, AsyncConnection]" is not assignable to "AsyncConnection"
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Looking at the error and the selected code, I can see there's an issue with the async/await syntax on line 168-169. The `conn.execution_options(isolation_level="AUTOCOMMIT")` is probably returning a coroutine that needs to be awaited, but then it's being passed to `_truncate_all_tables_via_conn(conn)` where `conn` is expected to be an `AsyncConnection`.

Let me examine the code more carefully:

```python
# —— 前置清理（不占用会话事务）——
async with pg_engine.connect() as conn:
    # 对 TRUNCATE 这类 DDL/批量清理，常用做法是用 AUTOCOMMIT
    conn = conn.execution_options(isolation_level="AUTOCOMMIT")
    await _truncate_all_tables_via_conn(conn)
```

The issue is likely that `execution_options()` on an async connection might return a coroutine that needs to be awaited, or that it creates a new connection object. Looking at SQLAlchemy async documentation, `execution_options()` on an `AsyncConnection` returns a new `AsyncConnection` object, not a coroutine, so that's not the issue.

Wait, let me look at the `_truncate_all_tables_via_conn` function signature:

```python
async def _truncate_all_tables_via_conn(conn: AsyncConnection, schemas: Iterable[str] = ("public",)) -> None:
```

It expects an `AsyncConnection`. The error suggests that `conn` is being treated as a coroutine type. This could happen if:

1. There's an issue with how `execution_options()` is being called
2. There's some async context manager issue
3. There's an import or type annotation issue

Looking at the SQLAlchemy docs, `execution_options()` on `AsyncConnection` should return a new `AsyncConnection` synchronously, not a coroutine. 


The coroutine type error suggests something is fundamentally wrong with how the connection is being created or manipulated. I might need to explicitly await the connection or check how the async context is being managed.

The potential causes range from improper awaiting to version-specific async behavior. The key insight is that reassigning the connection could be disrupting the expected async flow. A straightforward solution would involve maintaining the original connection and applying execution options directly within the async context.

I'll focus on ensuring the connection is properly awaited and not unnecessarily transformed, which could be causing the type mismatch.</details></think>

Looking at the error, the issue is with the `execution_options()` call on the async connection. In SQLAlchemy async, this method behavior can vary by version.

Here's a concise fix - avoid reassigning the connection and use execution options directly:

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The error persists, which means the issue is deeper. The `execution_options()` method on async connections might indeed be returning a coroutine in the current SQLAlchemy version. Let me look at the SQLAlchemy documentation to understand this better.

Actually, looking at the error more carefully, it seems like `execution_options()` on an async connection returns a coroutine that needs to be awaited. This would be different from the sync version.

Let me try awaiting the `execution_options()` call:</details></think>

## 修复完成！

**问题原因**：在 SQLAlchemy 异步连接中，`execution_options()` 方法返回一个需要等待的协程，而不是直接返回 `AsyncConnection` 对象。

**解决方案**：在 `execution_options()` 调用前添加 `await` 关键字：

```python
# 修复前
autocommit_conn = conn.execution_options(isolation_level="AUTOCOMMIT")

# 修复后  
autocommit_conn = await conn.execution_options(isolation_level="AUTOCOMMIT")
```

**修改内容**：
1. 在两处使用 `execution_options()` 的地方都添加了 `await`
2. 移除了未使用的 `alembic_dir` 变量

现在代码应该可以正常工作，不再有类型错误。
