# Fixing parameter error in code (2025-09-07 06:20Z)

_**User (2025-09-04 16:36Z)**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
No parameter named "lifespan"
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is getting an error "No parameter named 'lifespan'" when trying to use `ASGITransport(app=fastapi_app, lifespan="off")`. Looking at the code, they're trying to disable the lifespan to avoid heavy dependencies during testing.

Let me check what the issue might be. The error suggests that the `ASGITransport` constructor doesn't accept a `lifespan` parameter. This could be because:

1. The httpx version they're using doesn't support this parameter
2. The parameter name is different
3. They need to handle this differently

Looking at the comment in the code: "Use httpx>=0.24's ASGITransport to avoid lifespan", it seems like they expect this to work with httpx 0.24+.

Let me think about how to resolve this. There are a few approaches:

1. Check if there's a different parameter name
2. Use a different approach to bypass lifespan
3. Mock the lifespan dependencies instead

Looking at the httpx documentation and common patterns, the `lifespan` parameter might not be available in `ASGITransport`. Instead, they might need to:

1. Use a different approach to disable lifespan
2. Or handle the lifespan dependencies by mocking them

The most common approach would be to either:
- Remove the lifespan parameter and handle dependencies differently
- Use `app` parameter without lifespan control
- Mock the external dependencies that are causing issues in lifespan

Given the context and the comment about bypassing lifespan heavy deps, the simplest fix would be to remove the `lifespan="off"` parameter since `ASGITransport` by default doesn't run lifespan events unless specifically configured to do so.</details></think>

Looking at the error, the `ASGITransport` constructor doesn't accept a `lifespan` parameter. The good news is that `ASGITransport` doesn't run lifespan events by default anyway.

Here's the concise fix:

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The fix is simple - I just removed the `lifespan="off"` parameter from the `ASGITransport` constructor. This should resolve the error since:

1. `ASGITransport` doesn't accept a `lifespan` parameter
2. By default, `ASGITransport` doesn't run lifespan events anyway, so removing this parameter achieves the same goal
3. The comment already indicates they want to avoid lifespan, and this approach does that

The fix is concise and maintains the intended behavior of bypassing lifespan events during testing.</details></think>

The fix removes the unsupported `lifespan="off"` parameter. `ASGITransport` doesn't run lifespan events by default anyway, so this achieves the same goal of avoiding heavy lifespan dependencies during testing.

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Operator ">=" not supported for "None"
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Looking at the error, it seems like the issue is on line 98 where we have:

```python
assert count_evt >= 1
```

The error "Operator ">=" not supported for "None"" suggests that `count_evt` is returning `None` instead of an integer. This can happen when a scalar query returns no results.

The issue is likely that `db.scalar()` is returning `None` when there are no matching records, but we're trying to compare it with `>= 1`.

The fix would be to handle the case where `count_evt` might be `None` by either:
1. Using `or 0` to default to 0 if None
2. Checking if it's not None first
3. Using a different approach

Looking at the query:
```python
count_evt = await db.scalar(
    select(func.count()).select_from(DomainEvent).where(DomainEvent.aggregate_id == str(sid))
)
```

`func.count()` should always return an integer (0 or positive), but `db.scalar()` might return `None` if there's an issue. The safest fix is to handle the None case.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The fix I applied uses `(count_evt or 0) >= 1` which handles the case where `count_evt` might be `None`. If `count_evt` is `None`, it will evaluate to `0`, and then the comparison `0 >= 1` will be `False`, which seems like the right behavior for the test.

However, looking at the test more carefully, I should also apply the same fix to the similar query above it on line 90-93 to be consistent, in case that one might also potentially return None.</details></think>

The fix uses `(count_evt or 0) >= 1` to handle the case where `db.scalar()` returns `None`. This defaults to 0 if the result is `None`, making the comparison safe.

For the code present, we get this error:
```

```

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Looking at the error and the code, the issue is on line 160:

```python
assert uok["success"] and getattr(uok["session"], "version", None) == (ver + 1)
```

The error "Operator '+' not supported for 'None'" suggests that `ver` is `None`. Looking at the previous lines:

```python
# Read current version
ver = await db.scalar(select(ConversationSession.version).where(ConversationSession.id == sid))
```

The `db.scalar()` call can return `None` if there are no results or if the `version` column is NULL. Then when we try to do `ver + 1`, it fails because we can't add 1 to None.

The fix is to handle the case where `ver` might be `None`, similar to how we handled the previous issue.</details></think>

---

Looking at the error, `ver` is returning `None` from the scalar query, and then `ver + 1` fails. The issue is that `db.scalar()` can return `None` when the version field is NULL or no results are found.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The fix uses `(ver or 0) + 1` to handle the case where `ver` might be `None`. This defaults to 0 if the version is `None`, so the calculation becomes `0 + 1 = 1`, which is the expected next version.

This is consistent with the pattern I used in the previous fix for the count query.</details></think>

The fix uses `(ver or 0) + 1` to handle the case where `ver` might be `None`. This defaults to 0 if the version is `None`, making the addition safe and expecting the updated version to be 1.
