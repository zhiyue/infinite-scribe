_**User (2025-09-04 16:36Z)**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Argument to class must be a base class
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Looking at the error "Argument to class must be a base class" and the code snippet shown, I can see the issue is in line 87:

```python
class _AIOKafkaRebalanceAdapter(ConsumerRebalanceListener):
```

The error is happening because `ConsumerRebalanceListener` is not being properly imported or is not available as a base class. Looking at the import section at the top of the file, I can see:

```python
try:
    # aiokafka requires listener to be instance of this ABC
    from aiokafka.abc import ConsumerRebalanceListener  # type: ignore
except Exception:  # pragma: no cover - fallback for environments without aiokafka import at import time
    ConsumerRebalanceListener = object  # type: ignore
```

This is a fallback mechanism where if aiokafka is not available, `ConsumerRebalanceListener` gets set to `object`. However, there seems to be an issue with this approach because the type checker or runtime is complaining that the argument to the class is not a proper base class.

The issue is likely that when the import fails, `ConsumerRebalanceListener` is being set to `object` but this might not be working as expected in all scenarios.

The fix would be to make the fallback more robust. Instead of just setting it to `object`, we should create a proper base class or use a more explicit approach.

Let me propose a concise fix:</details></think>

---

Looking at the error and the code, the issue is with the fallback import mechanism for `ConsumerRebalanceListener`. When the import fails, it's set to `object`, but this may not work properly in all environments.

Here's a concise fix - replace the import section (lines 14-18) with:

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The fix I made replaces the fallback `ConsumerRebalanceListener = object` with a proper class definition. This should resolve the "Argument to class must be a base class" error because now `ConsumerRebalanceListener` will always be a proper class that can be used as a base class, whether it's the actual aiokafka ABC or our fallback class.

The fix is concise and maintains the same behavior - when aiokafka is available, it uses the real `ConsumerRebalanceListener` ABC, and when it's not available, it uses our simple fallback class.</details></think>

The fix replaces the `object` fallback with a proper class definition. This ensures `ConsumerRebalanceListener` is always a valid base class, whether imported from aiokafka or using the fallback.

_**User (2025-09-04 16:36Z)**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
"Never" is not awaitable
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is getting a "Never is not awaitable" error. Looking at the code, I can see that in the `_AIOKafkaRebalanceAdapter` class, there are methods that call `self._inner.on_partitions_assigned(assigned)` and `self._inner.on_partitions_revoked(revoked)`.

The issue is likely that the inner methods (`EventBridgeRebalanceListener.on_partitions_assigned` and `EventBridgeRebalanceListener.on_partitions_revoked`) are synchronous methods that return `None` (which has type `None`), but the code is checking if the result is a coroutine and trying to await it.

Looking at the `EventBridgeRebalanceListener` class, I can see:

```python
def on_partitions_assigned(self, assigned):
    # ... synchronous code ...
    # This returns None implicitly

def on_partitions_revoked(self, revoked):
    # ... synchronous code ...  
    # This returns None implicitly
```

The problem is in the adapter methods where it does:

```python
result = self._inner.on_partitions_assigned(assigned)
if asyncio.iscoroutine(result):
    await result
```

Since `result` is `None`, and the type checker sees that these methods never return a coroutine (they always return `None`), it's inferring the type as `Never` when trying to await it.

The fix is to simply not check if it's a coroutine since we know these methods are synchronous. We can just call them directly without the await logic.</details></think>

Looking at the error and the code, the issue is in the `_AIOKafkaRebalanceAdapter` methods. The inner methods are synchronous and always return `None`, so the coroutine check and await is unnecessary.

Here's the fix - replace the adapter methods:

_**User (2025-09-04 16:36Z)**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
"set_consumer" is not a known attribute of "None"
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The error indicates that `self.bridge_service` is `None` when `set_consumer` is called. Looking at the code, `self.bridge_service` is initialized in the `_initialize_service` method, but it seems like this method might not have been called before `_run_main_loop` is executed, or the service creation failed.

Looking at the flow in the `start` method:
1. `_initialize_service()` is called
2. Then `_run_main_loop()` is called

In `_initialize_service()`, `self.bridge_service` is set to `self.factory.create_event_bridge_service()`.

The issue is likely that the service creation is failing and returning `None`, or there's a race condition, or the initialization isn't happening properly.

Let me look at the code structure:

```python
async def start(self) -> None:
    try:
        # Initialize service
        await self._initialize_service()

        # Start main processing loop
        await self._run_main_loop()
    # ...
```

And in `_run_main_loop()`:
```python
# Set consumer reference in bridge service for offset management
self.bridge_service.set_consumer(consumer)
```

The fix would be to add a check to ensure `bridge_service` is not None before calling `set_consumer`.</details></think>

---

The error occurs because `self.bridge_service` is `None` when `set_consumer` is called. This likely happens if service initialization failed. 

Here's a concise fix - add a null check before the method call:

For the code present, we get this error:
```
"process_event" is not a known attribute of "None"
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is getting the same type of error as before - `self.bridge_service` is `None` and they're trying to call `process_event` on it. Looking at the code, there are multiple places where `self.bridge_service` is called without null checks:

1. Line 300: `continue_processing = await self.bridge_service.process_event(message)`
2. Line 335: `await self.bridge_service.commit_processed_offsets()`
3. Line 342: `health_status = self.bridge_service.get_health_status()`

The issue is that all these methods are being called but `self.bridge_service` might be `None`. I need to add null checks for all these calls, similar to what I did earlier.

However, looking at the broader context, it seems like if `bridge_service` is `None`, these methods shouldn't be called at all. The better approach might be to add null checks at the beginning of the methods that use `bridge_service`, or ensure that the service is properly initialized.

Since the user asked for a concise fix, I should add null checks for all the places where `bridge_service` is used.</details></think>

This is in the EventBridgeRebalanceListener class, not the main EventBridgeApplication class. The bridge_service is passed to the listener constructor, so it should not be None there unless it was None when passed. Since I already fixed the constructor call to check for None, this should be fine. But I should add a defensive check here too for robustness.</details></think>

Perfect! I've successfully fixed all the type errors in the EventBridge main.py file. Let me provide a summary of the changes made.</details></think>

---

修复已完成！我为 EventBridge main.py 文件中的所有类型错误添加了防护检查：

**修复的问题：**

1. **"Argument to class must be a base class"** - 修改了 `ConsumerRebalanceListener` 的回退机制，从 `object` 改为合适的类定义

2. **"Never is not awaitable"** - 移除了适配器方法中不必要的协程检查和 await 逻辑

3. **"set_consumer/process_event/etc. is not a known attribute of None"** - 为所有使用 `self.bridge_service` 的地方添加了 null 检查

**关键修改点：**
- `_AIOKafkaRebalanceAdapter` 中简化了异步方法实现
- 在关键服务方法调用前添加了 `bridge_service` 存在性验证
- 为分区分配监听器添加了防御性检查

所有修改都通过了 linting 检查，代码现在应该能够正常运行而不会出现这些类型错误。
