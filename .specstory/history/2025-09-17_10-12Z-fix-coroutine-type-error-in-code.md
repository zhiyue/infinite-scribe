# Fix coroutine type error in code (2025-09-17 10:12Z)

_**User (2025-09-17 08:04Z)**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
"CoroutineType[Any, Any, AsyncIterator[LLMStreamEvent]]" is not iterable
  "__aiter__" method not defined
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Diagnosing Async Issues**

I'm currently investigating a type error reported in an async generator function. It seems the code is complaining about the coroutine not being iterable, with a missing `__aiter__` method. My focus is on pinpointing the exact location where the async generator is incorrectly used or its return value is being misinterpreted as a regular iterable.


**Tracking Down the Adapter**

I've started examining the `ProviderAdapter` class and its `stream` method, using `grep` to locate its definition within the external client files. It seems the issue stems from the adapter not directly returning an `AsyncIterator`, but rather a coroutine. Now, I'm focusing on understanding the exact implementation of the `stream` method within the `ProviderAdapter` to identify the point where the coroutine is created and if `await` is missing.


**Exploring ProviderAdapter Stream**

I've identified that the issue centers around line 38 in `service.py`, where `adapter.stream(req)` is called. The error strongly suggests that the return value is a coroutine, not an async iterator. I'm now focused on tracing the `ProviderAdapter.stream` implementation to understand how its return value is constructed, particularly looking for missing `await` calls or incorrect object instantiation. I'm planning to list the files in the directory to understand the module structure better before searching.

Okay, I see the issue. The error message `is not iterable` on a coroutine type typically means you're forgetting to `await` an `async` function that returns an iterator.

I will now fix this for you.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating the Solution**

I've just confirmed that the fix I proposed has been successfully implemented. The original error, stemming from the non-iterability of a coroutine object, is now resolved. I'm confident this will address the user's issue.


**Addressing the Core Issue**

I've finished applying the fix – just a single word addition, as predicted! The non-iterable coroutine error was directly linked to the lack of `await`. I'm also planning to check the code using `read_lints` to ensure everything is clean. I'm ready to communicate this to the user, confident in the solution.


</details></think>

I've applied the fix. The error message indicated that an awaitable object (a coroutine) was being used in a context that expected an async iterator. The solution was to `await` the call to `adapter.stream(req)`, which resolves the coroutine and returns the async iterator needed for the `async for` loop.

I'll just check for any new linter errors in the file.

I've confirmed the fix is deployed and the code is clean, adhering to the requested brevity. I'm satisfied that this addresses the user's problem effectively. My final response is ready.


</details></think>

I've applied the fix to `apps/backend/src/services/llm/service.py`.

The error you were seeing occurs because `adapter.stream(req)` is a coroutine that *returns* an async iterator, so it needs to be awaited before you can iterate over it. I've added the `await` keyword, which should resolve the problem.

For the code present, we get this error:
```
"AsyncIterator[LLMStreamEvent]" is not awaitable
  "AsyncIterator[LLMStreamEvent]" is incompatible with protocol "Awaitable[_T_co@Awaitable]"
    "__await__" is not present
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Debugging the Await**

I've identified a type error in the test file: I'm inappropriately using `await`. The error message confirms that I am attempting to await an `AsyncIterator`, which is, by definition, already asynchronous and does not require awaiting. I seem to have mixed up the use of `await` in the previous stages of development.


**Revising the Async Iterator**

I'm diagnosing a mismatch between the test file and the service's `stream` function. I made a mistake by adding an `await` when the function already returns an async iterator. The test code now incorrectly attempts to await an already asynchronous object. It appears I need to remove the extra `await` in the test file to fix the type error, as `service.stream(req)` is designed to directly produce the stream. I'll make the necessary adjustment to the test.


**Pinpointing the Root Cause**

I'm back to the test file, and the error message points to the opposite problem. The service function returns an `AsyncIterator`, which should not be awaited. I erroneously added an `await` to both the service and the test, over-complicating the asynchronous execution flow. It looks like the change in service.py was correct; it's in the test file where the correction is needed. I'm pretty sure the `await` has to be removed from the test file.


**Clarifying the Async Flow**

I'm now addressing the core issue: the test file's error. The error message, "AsyncIterator[LLMStreamEvent] is not awaitable," is illuminating. This suggests the `service.stream(req)` function now directly returns an `AsyncIterator`, confirmed by my changes to the underlying service. This means I need to adjust the test file by removing the redundant `await` call to properly iterate through the stream.


**Finalizing the Adjustment**

I've pinpointed the issue, and it's now clear where the error lies. The test file is incorrectly attempting to `await` an `AsyncIterator`. The `service.stream(req)` function returns an `AsyncIterator` directly, not a coroutine that needs awaiting. I'll edit the test file by removing the redundant `await` to correctly iterate through the stream. I've prepared the change, it involves simply removing `await` from the `async for` loop in the test code.


**Addressing the Test's Error**

I'm dealing with the latest error, "AsyncIterator[LLMStreamEvent] is not awaitable," which means I'm incorrectly trying to `await` the async iterator returned by `service.stream(req)`. This suggests my fix to the service.py was correct, as the test now needs adjusting to handle the async generator function's direct `AsyncIterator` return. My focus now is fixing the test's `async for` loop.

You've encountered the opposite issue now.

The `service.stream` method is an async generator. Calling it returns an async iterator directly, which is not awaitable. The `await` keyword should be used on coroutines, but `async for` is used to consume async iterators.

I will remove the unnecessary `await` for you.

You're right, my apologies. That previous change fixed the implementation but created an issue at the call site.

The error `is not awaitable` indicates that the `service.stream` method, being an async generator, returns an async iterator directly. This iterator should be used in an `async for` loop without `await`.

I have removed the unnecessary `await` from the test file.

I will quickly check for linter errors.

I've corrected the file. The issue was that `service.stream` is an async generator, which returns an async iterator that you can loop over directly with `async for` without needing to `await` it first. The fix I applied in the previous step made the test code incorrect.

This should resolve the error. Let me know if you have any other questions.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Troubleshooting Async Error**

I've identified a `TypeError` within the `src/services/llm/service.py` file, specifically at line 38. The traceback points to an issue with an `async_generator` not being compatible with an `await` expression. My focus is now on the `async for event in await adapter.stream(req):` line to determine the root cause of the incompatibility.


**Diagnosing the Async Generator**

I'm wrestling with the `async_generator` now. The traceback confirms the `adapter.stream(req)` returns one, confirming my suspicion. It seems I need to refactor that `async for` loop, as awaiting the stream directly is causing the type error. I'm considering iterating through the stream without `await`, as that might resolve the core issue.


**Unraveling the Type Confusion**

I'm seeing a type conflict. It appears that `adapter.stream(req)` is sometimes returning an async generator, and other times a coroutine that yields an async iterator. I suspect the different adapter implementations are the source of the type inconsistency, specifically with the `stream` methods. The first reported error points toward a coroutine, and the latest confirms an async generator. Time to inspect the adapter code!


**Deciphering Adapter Behavior**

I'm back to the source code, and I'm confused, to say the least. The inconsistent type behavior of the `adapter.stream` calls has me baffled, especially with the `async_generator` error. I'm examining the adapter implementations and their return types closely, suspecting that some are using `yield` while others return the generator directly, leading to these contradictory errors.


**Re-Evaluating Adapter Types**

I'm circling back to the initial problem, which seems to be related to incorrect assumptions about the return types from `adapter.stream(req)`. My previous attempts to fix the code, based on the initial error, have been proven wrong. The `TypeError` clearly indicates that the stream returns an `async_generator` and shouldn't be awaited, so the original implementation in `service.py` should have worked fine.


**Tracing the ProviderAdapter**

I'm now focusing on the `ProviderAdapter` interface definition. The original `TypeError` highlighted the incorrect use of `await`. I'll examine the expected behavior of the `stream` method, checking if it's supposed to return an async generator or a coroutine. This should clear up the confusion surrounding the `await` calls.
