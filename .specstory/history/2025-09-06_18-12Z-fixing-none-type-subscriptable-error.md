# Fixing None type subscriptable error (2025-09-06 18:12Z)

_**User (2025-09-04 16:36Z)**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Object of type "None" is not subscriptable
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Looking at the linter errors, I can see the issue is on lines 110-111 where we have:

```python
assert consumed_message is not None, "Failed to consume message from Kafka"
assert consumed_message.value["id"] == test_message["id"]
assert consumed_message.value["message"] == test_message["message"]
```

The linter is complaining that `Object of type "None" is not subscriptable` on lines 110 and 111. This is a type inference issue - even though we have an assertion that `consumed_message is not None` on line 109, the type checker isn't understanding that this means `consumed_message` cannot be None on the subsequent lines.

This is a common issue with type checkers like mypy. The solution is to either:
1. Use type narrowing that the type checker understands better
2. Use a more explicit type check
3. Restructure the code to avoid the issue

Looking at the code, the most concise fix would be to restructure it slightly so that we check if the message is not None and then access its properties within that check, or use a return/continue pattern to make it clear to the type checker.

Let me look at the code more carefully:

```python
# Verify we got the message
assert consumed_message is not None, "Failed to consume message from Kafka"
assert consumed_message.value["id"] == test_message["id"]
assert consumed_message.value["message"] == test_message["message"]
```

The most concise fix would be to restructure this to make the type checker happy. I can either:
1. Add a type annotation or cast
2. Use an if statement instead of assert for the None check
3. Combine the assertions

I think the most concise approach is to restructure this into a single block that makes it clear to the type checker that consumed_message is not None when we access its properties.</details></think>

Looking at the linter error, the type checker doesn't understand that `consumed_message` cannot be None after the assertion. Here's a concise fix:

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The linter is still complaining. Let me think about this differently. The issue might be that the type checker still thinks consumed_message could be None even after the assertion. Let me try a different approach - using an if statement instead of an assertion, or using a type comment to help the type checker understand.

Actually, let me look at this more carefully. The issue might be that even though we assert consumed_message is not None, the type checker doesn't understand that consumed_message.value itself won't be None. Let me try a more explicit approach.</details></think>

The linter is still not satisfied. Let me try a more explicit approach:

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Great! The linter errors are now resolved. The fix was to add an explicit assertion that `consumed_message.value is not None` before trying to access its dictionary keys. This helps the type checker understand that the value is not None when we try to subscript it with ["id"] and ["message"].

Let me provide a brief explanation of the fix to the user.</details></think>

Perfect! The fix is now complete. The issue was that the type checker couldn't infer that `consumed_message.value` was not None, even after asserting that `consumed_message` itself was not None.

**The fix:** Added an explicit assertion `assert consumed_message.value is not None, "Message value is None"` before accessing the dictionary keys. This tells the type checker that the `.value` attribute is safe to subscript.

The linter errors are now resolved.
