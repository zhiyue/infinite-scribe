# Fixing invalid conditional operand error (2025-07-05 08:09Z)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Invalid conditional operand of type "Column[str]"
  Method __bool__ for type "Column[str]" returns type "Never" rather than "bool"
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.
