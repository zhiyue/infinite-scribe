# Fixing None type subscriptable error (2025-06-27 06:33Z)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:

```
Object of type "None" is not subscriptable
```

How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Looking at the linter errors
and the code, I can see several issues:

1. Line 52: `Object of type "None" is not subscriptable` - This is happening
   because `result.single()` can return `None` when there are no records, but
   the code is trying to access `record["value"]` without checking if `record`
   is None.

2. There are also issues with `self._driver` potentially being None in other
   places, but the main issue the user is asking about is the subscriptable
   error.

The fix for line 52 should be to check if `record` is None before trying to
access it. Since this is a connection check that's running "RETURN 1 AS value",
it should always return a record, but we should still handle the case where it
doesn't.

Let me provide a concise fix for this specific issue.</details></think>

The error occurs because `result.single()` can return `None` when no records are
found. Here's the fix:

---

---

The fix adds a null check before accessing the record's value. This ensures we
don't try to subscript `None` if `result.single()` returns no records.

For the code present, we get this error:

```
Item "None" of "Any | None" has no attribute "session"
```

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The error is occurring because
the type checker sees that `self._driver` could be `None` (as initialized in
`__init__`), and it's trying to access `.session()` on a potentially `None`
value.

Looking at the code, I can see there are multiple places where this error
occurs:

1. Line 60 in `verify_constraints` method
2. Line 86 in `execute` method

The issue is that these methods don't ensure the driver is connected before
using it. The `execute` method does have a check at line 84
`if self._driver is None: await self.connect()`, but the type checker still sees
`_driver` as potentially `None`.

For `verify_constraints`, there's no such check at all.

The fix is to:

1. Add connection checks where missing
2. Add type assertions or ensure the driver is not None after connection
   attempts

Let me look at the current state of the code to see exactly what needs to be
fixed.</details></think>

The error occurs because the type checker sees `self._driver` could be `None`.
Here are the fixes:

---

---

---

The fixes add proper null checks:

1. In `verify_constraints`: Check if driver is None, connect if needed, return
   False if still None
2. In `execute`: Add a second check after connection attempt and raise an error
   if driver is still None

This ensures the driver is never None when accessing `.session()`.

For the code present, we get this error:

```
Argument of type "str" cannot be assigned to parameter "query" of type "LiteralString | Query" in function "run"
  Type "str" is not assignable to type "LiteralString | Query"
    "str" is not assignable to "LiteralString"
    "str" is not assignable to "Query"

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is getting a type
error where the `session.run()` method expects a `LiteralString | Query` but is
receiving a `str`. This is likely due to strict type checking where the Neo4j
driver expects either a literal string (known at compile time) or a Query
object, but not a dynamic string.

Looking at the method signature:

```python
async def execute(self, query: str, parameters: dict | None = None):
```

The `query` parameter is typed as `str`, but the Neo4j driver's `run` method
expects `LiteralString | Query`.

The fix would be to either:

1. Change the type annotation to accept `LiteralString` instead of `str`
2. Or cast the string to the appropriate type
3. Or use a type ignore comment

Given that this is a service method that should accept dynamic queries, option 2
(casting) or 3 (type ignore) would be most appropriate. The casting approach
would be cleaner.

Actually, looking at this more carefully, the issue is that Neo4j's type system
is very strict about SQL injection prevention. The `LiteralString` type is used
to ensure queries are compile-time constants, not runtime-constructed strings
that could contain user input.

For a service method like this that needs to accept dynamic queries, we should
either:

1. Cast the string
2. Use a type ignore comment
3. Change the method signature to accept the proper type

Since this is a utility method that should accept dynamic queries, I think the
cleanest solution is to cast it.</details></think>

The error occurs because Neo4j's driver expects a `LiteralString` for security
reasons. Here's the fix:

Let me fix this with the proper type ignore format:

---

---

Let me try casting the string instead:

---

---

---

Given the persistent type checking issues, I'll use a different approach. The
type checker is being very strict about Neo4j's security requirements. Let me
use the proper type annotation:

---

---

I've reached the 3-attempt limit for fixing linter errors. Let me provide a
clean solution:

---

---

The type ignore comment should resolve the Neo4j type checking issue. The
"unused" warning suggests your linter might not be recognizing the type error,
but the comment is necessary for the strict type checking that Neo4j enforces
for security reasons.

For the code present, we get this error:

```
Unused "type: ignore" comment
```

How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is getting an "Unused
'type: ignore' comment" error. This suggests that the linter is not actually
seeing the type error that the type: ignore comment is meant to suppress. This
could happen if:

1. The linter configuration is different
2. The type checking is not as strict as expected
3. The type error was resolved by other means

Since the user just wants a concise fix, I should simply remove the unused type:
ignore comment.</details></think>

---

The linter indicates the type ignore comment is unused, meaning the type error
isn't being detected. Simply remove it:

---

---

The unused type ignore comment has been removed. If you encounter the original
type error again, it may be due to different linter configurations or Neo4j
version differences.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The error is back, showing
that the Neo4j driver expects a LiteralString for security reasons. I need to
fix this properly. Let me think about the options:

1. Use type ignore comment (but this was marked as unused before, though now the
   error is back)
2. Import Query from neo4j and use proper typing
3. Use a different approach

The safest approach is to use the type ignore comment with the proper format
since this is a known limitation when using dynamic queries with Neo4j's strict
typing.</details></think>

The error is back. Use the type ignore comment with the correct format:

---

---

There seems to be inconsistent linter behavior. Let me try a different approach
by importing the proper type:

---

---

---

I'm at the limit for fixing linter errors. The issue is that Neo4j enforces
strict typing for security (preventing SQL injection-like attacks). The most
practical solution in production code would be to use a type ignore comment, but
your linter configuration seems inconsistent about when it's needed.

The root cause is that Neo4j requires `LiteralString` (compile-time string
literals) rather than runtime `str` values for security. This is a common issue
when building dynamic queries.
