Checking for leftover test containers... 为什么程序执行到这里就中断了?

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is running
integration tests with the `--docker-host` option. The tests passed (10 passed
in -128.37s), but the execution seems to hang at the "Checking for leftover test
containers..." step. Looking at the script, this is the cleanup phase where it
tries to check for leftover test containers.

Let me analyze the script logic:

1. After tests run successfully, if `USE_DOCKER_HOST` is true, it tries to check
   for leftover containers
2. It first tries to use the local `docker` command to connect to the remote
   Docker host
3. If that fails, it falls back to SSH
4. The script seems to be hanging during this container cleanup check

Looking at the relevant part of the script:

````bash
# Clean up if using Docker host
if [ "$USE_DOCKER_HOST" = true ]; then
    echo -e "\n${YELLOW}Checking for leftover test containers...${NC}"

    # Try local docker command first if available
    if command -v docker &> /dev/null; then
        # Redirect both stdout and stderr to capture any error messages
        leftover_containers=$(docker -H ${REMOTE_DOCKER_HOST} ps -a --filter "name=test" --format "{{.Names}}" 2>&1)
        # Check if the output contains error messages
        if [[ "$leftover_containers" == *"command 'docker' could not be found"* ]] || [[ "$leftover_containers" == *"Cannot connect to the Docker daemon"* ]] || [[ "$leftover_containers" == *"could not be found"* ]]; then
            # Clear the error message and try SSH fallback
            leftover_containers=""
            if command -v ssh &> /dev/null; then
                leftover_containers=$(ssh -o ConnectTimeout=5 -o BatchMode=yes zhiyue@${DOCKER_HOST_IP} 'docker ps -a --filter "name=test" --format "{{.Names}}"' 2>/dev/null || echo "")
                echo -e "${YELLOW}Falling back to SSH to check for leftover containers${NC}"
            else
                echo -e "${YELLOW}No alternative method to check for containers${NC}"
            fi
        fi
    fi

I see the script is implementing multiple fallback mechanisms to identify leftover test containers. The primary challenge appears to be establishing a reliable connection to the Docker host, with local Docker CLI and SSH being the two primary methods attempted. The script is designed to gracefully handle connection failures by trying alternative approaches.

If containers are successfully detected, it will display their names; otherwise, it confirms no leftover containers exist. The approach ensures robust container tracking across different network and access scenarios.

The Docker command targeting the remote host appears problematic, potentially stalling due to connectivity or daemon responsiveness issues. Network instability or unresponsive Docker daemon could cause indefinite hanging during container enumeration.</details></think>

Looking at your test execution, the integration tests completed successfully (10 passed), but the script is hanging at the cleanup phase where it checks for leftover Docker containers.

The issue is likely that the Docker command is hanging without a timeout when trying to connect to the remote Docker host. Let me analyze the script and suggest a fix.

---

Read file: scripts/run-tests.sh

---

I can see the issue. The script is hanging at line 216 where it tries to execute:

```bash
leftover_containers=$(docker -H ${REMOTE_DOCKER_HOST} ps -a --filter "name=test" --format "{{.Names}}" 2>&1)
````

The problem is that this Docker command doesn't have a timeout and can hang
indefinitely if the remote Docker host is not responding properly. Since you've
already established that the Docker CLI connection fails (we saw "✗ Failed to
connect via Docker CLI" earlier), but the script detected that Docker CLI is
available, it's trying the Docker command first and hanging.

Let me fix this by adding a timeout to the Docker command and improving the
error detection logic:

---

---

The issue was that the script was attempting to use the Docker CLI to connect to
the remote Docker host without a timeout, even though it had already established
that the Docker CLI connection failed during the initial connectivity test.

The key improvements I made:

1. **Added timeout**: Used `timeout 10` to prevent the Docker command from
   hanging indefinitely
2. **Reused connectivity test logic**: Instead of trying Docker CLI again, the
   script now reuses the same connectivity test logic that was already performed
   earlier
3. **Clearer fallback logic**: Since we know from the earlier test that SSH
   works but Docker CLI doesn't, the script will now go directly to SSH
4. **Better user feedback**: Added messages to show which method is being used

Now when you run the test script, it should:

1. Skip the hanging Docker CLI command since it already knows it doesn't work
2. Use SSH (which we know works) to check for leftover containers
3. Complete the cleanup process quickly

You can now run your integration tests again:

```bash
./scripts/run-tests.sh --integration --docker-host
```

The script should complete successfully without hanging at the container cleanup
step.
