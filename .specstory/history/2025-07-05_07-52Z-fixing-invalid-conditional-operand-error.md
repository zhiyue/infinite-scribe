# Fixing invalid conditional operand error (2025-07-05 07:52Z)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Invalid conditional operand of type "Column[bool]"
  Method __bool__ for type "Column[bool]" returns type "Never" rather than "bool"
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Looking at the linter errors, I can see that there are issues with SQLAlchemy column attributes being used in Python contexts where the type checker expects actual Python values rather than SQLAlchemy column objects.

The specific error the user is asking about is:
```
Invalid conditional operand of type "Column[bool]"
  Method __bool__ for type "Column[bool]" returns type "Never" rather than "bool"
```

This happens on line 144:
```python
if not user.is_verified:
```

The issue is that `user.is_verified` is a SQLAlchemy Column, not a Python boolean. When you try to use it in a conditional statement, SQLAlchemy's type system doesn't allow this because it's designed to prevent accidental misuse of column objects in Python contexts.

Looking at the broader context, I can see similar issues throughout the file where SQLAlchemy column values are being used as if they were Python values. This suggests that the User model is using SQLAlchemy's declarative approach, but the code is trying to access the attributes as if they were regular Python attributes.

There are a few ways to fix this:

1. Use the actual attribute values by accessing them correctly
2. Ensure the User object is properly loaded from the database so the attributes contain actual values
3. Make sure the User model is properly defined

Looking at the code, the user object is being fetched from the database with:
```python
result = await db.execute(select(User).where(User.email == email))
user = result.scalar_one_or_none()
```

This should return a User instance with actual values, not Column objects. The issue might be in how the User model is defined or how the attributes are being accessed.

The most likely issue is that the User model attributes are defined as SQLAlchemy columns, but when we fetch the user from the database, we should get an instance with actual values, not Column objects.

However, looking at this more carefully, the issue might be that the type hints or model definition is causing the type checker to think these are still Column objects when they should be the actual values.


I'll verify the attribute access to ensure we're working with the correct value type. The type checker seems to be misinterpreting the `is_verified` attribute, suggesting a potential type annotation problem in the User model definition. I'll focus on explicitly accessing the boolean value to resolve the type checking issue.

The most direct solutions include using `getattr()` to safely retrieve the value, accessing the instance dictionary, or refining the model's type annotations to clarify the attribute's nature. Ensuring proper type distinction between class-level Column definitions and instance-level values will provide the most robust resolution.</details></think>

The error occurs because SQLAlchemy's type checker sees `user.is_verified` as a `Column[bool]` rather than a `bool` value. This happens when the User model's type annotations aren't properly distinguishing between class-level column definitions and instance-level values.

**Concise fix for line 144:**
