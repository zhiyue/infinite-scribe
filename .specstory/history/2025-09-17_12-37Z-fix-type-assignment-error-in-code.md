# Fix type assignment error in code (2025-09-17 12:37Z)

_**User (2025-09-17 08:04Z)**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Type "Result[Tuple[GenesisStageRecord]]" is not assignable to declared type "dict[str, Any] | None"
  Type "Result[Tuple[GenesisStageRecord]]" is not assignable to type "dict[str, Any] | None"
    "Result[Tuple[GenesisStageRecord]]" is not assignable to "dict[str, Any]"
    "Result[Tuple[GenesisStageRecord]]" is not assignable to "None"
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Looking at the code, I can see the issue. The user is getting a type error on line 222 where `result` is being assigned. The problem is that there's a variable name conflict.

On line 214, there's a parameter named `result` with type `dict[str, Any] | None`:
```python
result: dict[str, Any] | None = None,
```

Then on line 222, they're trying to assign the result of the SQL execution to the same variable name `result`:
```python
result = await self.db.execute(
    sql_update(GenesisStageRecord)
    .where(GenesisStageRecord.id == stage_id)
    .values(**update_values)
    .returning(GenesisStageRecord)
)
```

The SQL execution returns a `Result[Tuple[GenesisStageRecord]]` type, but the `result` variable was already declared as a parameter with type `dict[str, Any] | None`.

The fix is simple - rename the variable that captures the SQL execution result to something else, like `update_result` or `query_result`.</details></think>

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Cannot access attribute "scalar_one_or_none" for class "dict[str, Any]"

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Looking at the error message and the code, there's a variable naming conflict. The issue is in line 222 where we have:

```python
result = await self.db.execute(...)
```

But there's also a parameter named `result` in the function signature:

```python
async def update(
    self,
    stage_id: UUID,
    status: StageStatus | None = None,
    config: dict[str, Any] | None = None,
    result: dict[str, Any] | None = None,  # This parameter
    iteration_count: int | None = None,
    metrics: dict[str, Any] | None = None,
) -> GenesisStageRecord | None:
```

So when we do `result = await self.db.execute(...)`, we're shadowing the parameter `result` with the SQLAlchemy Result object. Then on line 229, when we try to call `result.scalar_one_or_none()`, Python thinks `result` is the parameter (which is `dict[str, Any] | None`) rather than the SQLAlchemy Result object.

The fix is simple: rename the variable that holds the SQLAlchemy Result to something else, like `query_result` or `update_result`.</details></think>

---

The issue is a variable name collision. The `result` variable is shadowing the `result` parameter in the function signature.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The fix is simple and resolves the variable name collision. The issue was that the `result` parameter in the function signature was being shadowed by the `result` variable that was assigned the SQLAlchemy Result object. By renaming the SQLAlchemy Result to `update_result`, we avoid the collision and the type checker can properly understand that `update_result` is a SQLAlchemy Result object that has the `scalar_one_or_none()` method.

This is a concise fix that addresses exactly the issue described in the error message.</details></think>

Fixed by renaming the SQLAlchemy Result variable from `result` to `update_result` to avoid shadowing the function parameter `result: dict[str, Any] | None`.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The error is happening because the user is using `GenesisStageSession.is_primary is True` in a SQLAlchemy query. This is incorrect because `is True` is a Python identity check, but in SQLAlchemy queries you need to use the `==` operator for comparison.

Looking at the code:
```python
GenesisStageSession.is_primary is True,
```

This should be:
```python
GenesisStageSession.is_primary == True,
```

Or even better, since it's a boolean field, just:
```python
GenesisStageSession.is_primary,
```

Let me fix this.</details></think>

---

The issue is using `is True` instead of `== True` in the SQLAlchemy query. The `is` operator doesn't work in SQL expressions.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is showing a type error related to line 208 in the stage_session_repository.py file. Looking at the selected code, I can see:

```python
update_values: dict[str, any] = {}
```

The error message "Expected class but received "(iterable: Iterable[object], /) -> bool"" suggests that `any` is being interpreted as the built-in `any()` function rather than a type. This is a case sensitivity issue - it should be `Any` (capitalized) from the typing module, not `any` (lowercase).

Let me fix this by changing `any` to `Any`.</details></think>

---

The issue is using lowercase `any` instead of the proper type `Any`. The lowercase `any` refers to the built-in function, not the type.
