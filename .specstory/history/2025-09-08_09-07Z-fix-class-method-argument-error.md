# Fix class method argument error (2025-09-08 09:07Z)

_**User (2025-09-04 16:36Z)**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
First argument of a class method should be named `cls`
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Looking at the attached code, I can see the issue is in the `create_provider` method on line 25-26:

```python
@classmethod
def create_provider(
    self, provider_type: str | None = None, base_url: str | None = None, model: str | None = None, **kwargs
) -> EmbeddingProvider:
```

The error message is clear - for a class method (decorated with `@classmethod`), the first parameter should be named `cls` instead of `self`. `self` is used for instance methods, while `cls` is the convention for class methods.

Looking at the rest of the code, I can see that other class methods in this file correctly use `cls` as the first parameter:
- `get_default_provider(cls)`  
- `register_provider(cls, name: str, provider_class: type[EmbeddingProvider])`
- `list_available_providers(cls)`

So this is just a simple naming issue where `self` should be changed to `cls` in the `create_provider` method signature.</details></think>

The issue is that the `create_provider` method is decorated with `@classmethod` but uses `self` instead of `cls` as the first parameter. For class methods, the first parameter should always be named `cls`.

Here's the fix:

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect, I've fixed the issue. Let me summarize what was done:

1. Changed the first parameter from `self` to `cls` in the method signature
2. Updated all references within the method body from `self._providers` to `cls._providers`

This should resolve the linting error about class methods needing to use `cls` as the first parameter name. The fix is concise and addresses exactly what the error message indicated.</details></think>

The fix is complete. I've changed:
1. The first parameter from `self` to `cls` in the method signature
2. All references within the method from `self._providers` to `cls._providers`

This resolves the linting error since class methods should use `cls` as the first parameter name to reference the class, not `self` which is for instance methods.

For the code present, we get this error:
```

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The error indicates that the type checker is having trouble with the assignment `cls._providers[name] = provider_class`. Let me look at the context to understand the issue.

From the error message, it seems like the `_providers` dictionary is typed too narrowly. The error suggests that `_providers` expects values of type `type[OllamaEmbeddingProvider]` but we're trying to assign `type[EmbeddingProvider]`.

This usually happens when the `_providers` dictionary is inferred to have a specific concrete type rather than the more general base type. Let me check the current definition of `_providers` in the file.

Looking at the file, I can see:
```python
_providers = {
    "ollama": OllamaEmbeddingProvider,
    # Future providers can be added here:
    # "openai": OpenAIEmbeddingProvider,
    # "anthropic": AnthropicEmbeddingProvider,
    # "huggingface": HuggingFaceEmbeddingProvider,
}
```

The issue is that Python's type inference is making `_providers` have type `dict[str, type[OllamaEmbeddingProvider]]` because that's the only concrete type in the dictionary. But we want it to be `dict[str, type[EmbeddingProvider]]` so we can store any subclass of `EmbeddingProvider`.

The fix is to add a type annotation to the `_providers` class attribute to explicitly specify that it should hold `type[EmbeddingProvider]` values.</details></think>

---

The issue is that the `_providers` dictionary is being inferred to have a narrow type based on the existing `OllamaEmbeddingProvider` entry. We need to explicitly type it to accept any `EmbeddingProvider` subclass.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I've added the type annotation `dict[str, type[EmbeddingProvider]]` to the `_providers` class attribute. This explicitly tells the type checker that the dictionary values should be types that are subclasses of `EmbeddingProvider`, which will allow the `register_provider` method to work correctly when assigning `provider_class` (which is of type `type[EmbeddingProvider]`) to `cls._providers[name]`.

This fix is concise and directly addresses the type error without changing the functionality.</details></think>

The fix adds an explicit type annotation to the `_providers` class attribute, specifying that it should hold `type[EmbeddingProvider]` values. This allows the type checker to understand that any subclass of `EmbeddingProvider` can be stored in the dictionary, resolving the assignment error in the `register_provider` method.

For the code present, we get this error:
```
No parameter named "base_url"

How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is getting an error that says "No parameter named "base_url"" for the line where we're calling `provider_class(base_url=base_url, model=model, **kwargs)`. This suggests that the provider class (likely `OllamaEmbeddingProvider` or potentially the base `EmbeddingProvider` class) doesn't accept a `base_url` parameter in its constructor.

I need to look at the base class and/or the Ollama provider to understand what parameters they actually accept. Let me check the base class and the Ollama provider.</details></think>

I need to check what parameters the provider classes actually accept. Let me examine the base class and Ollama provider:

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! Now I can see the issue. The `OllamaEmbeddingProvider` constructor does accept `base_url`, `model`, and `timeout` parameters. However, looking at line 52 in the factory, it's calling `provider_class(base_url=base_url, model=model, **kwargs)`.

The error "No parameter named 'base_url'" suggests that the type checker is looking at the base `EmbeddingProvider` class, which doesn't have a constructor signature. The issue is that the base `EmbeddingProvider` class is abstract and doesn't define `__init__`, so the type checker can't know what parameters the concrete implementations will accept.

The solution is to ensure we're only passing the parameters that we know the specific provider accepts. Since we can't know at compile time what parameters each provider needs, we should let the `**kwargs` handle all the parameters, or we need to handle this more carefully.

Looking at the Ollama implementation, it accepts `base_url`, `model`, and `timeout`. The factory method currently tries to pass these as named parameters, but since the type is `type[EmbeddingProvider]`, the type checker doesn't know these parameters exist.

The cleanest solution is to pass all parameters through `**kwargs`:</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>This solution avoids the type checker error by only passing parameters that are not None and using **kwargs for all parameters.

---

The fix collects all non-None parameters into a dictionary and passes them via `**kwargs`. This avoids the type checker error since the abstract base class doesn't define constructor parameters, while still allowing each concrete provider to receive the parameters it expects.
