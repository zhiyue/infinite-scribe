# Fixing invalid conditional operand error (2025-07-10 11:17Z)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Invalid conditional operand of type "Column[datetime]"
  Method __bool__ for type "Column[datetime]" returns type "Never" rather than "bool"
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is getting a linter error about invalid conditional operands in their User model's `to_dict` method. Looking at the error and the code, the issue is on lines 104-105 where they're checking:

```python
"created_at": self.created_at.isoformat() if self.created_at else None,
"updated_at": self.updated_at.isoformat() if self.updated_at else None,
```

The error message says that `self.created_at` and `self.updated_at` are of type `Column[datetime]` and their `__bool__` method returns `Never` rather than `bool`. This suggests that these fields are SQLAlchemy column definitions rather than actual datetime values.

Looking at the User model, I can see that `created_at` and `updated_at` are defined as:

```python
# From the BaseModel, these are likely defined as:
# created_at: Mapped[datetime] = mapped_column(default=datetime.utcnow)
# updated_at: Mapped[datetime] = mapped_column(default=datetime.utcnow)
```

But wait, let me look more carefully. In the comment it says "# 假设你有一个 BaseModel" (assumes you have a BaseModel). So the `created_at` and `updated_at` fields are likely inherited from BaseModel, but they might be defined as nullable in the BaseModel.

Actually, looking at the database schema in the architecture document, I can see:

```sql
created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
```

So these should be NOT NULL fields. But the Python model might have them defined as potentially nullable (`datetime | None`) which is causing the type checker to complain.

The issue is that the type checker is seeing these as potentially None, but the conditional check `if self.created_at` is not behaving as expected for SQLAlchemy columns.
