"""
ASGI middleware to gracefully swallow asyncio.CancelledError during shutdown/reload.

Context:
- Long-lived streaming endpoints (like SSE) often get cancelled when the server
  reloads or receives SIGINT/SIGTERM. This surfaces as asyncio.CancelledError
  bubbling up to Uvicorn, which logs an error stacktrace even though it's expected.

This middleware catches CancelledError at the ASGI boundary and downgrades it to
an info log so shutdown stays clean without noisy tracebacks.
