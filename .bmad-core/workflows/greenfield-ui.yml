    Agent workflow for building frontend applications from concept to development.
    Supports both comprehensive planning for complex UIs and rapid prototyping for simple interfaces.
  type: greenfield

      creates: project-brief.md
      optional_steps:
        - brainstorming_session
        - market_research_prompt
      notes: "Can do brainstorming first, then optional deep research before creating project brief. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final project-brief.md to your project's docs/ folder."

    - agent: pm
      creates: prd.md
      requires: project-brief.md
      notes: "Creates PRD from project brief using prd-tmpl, focused on UI/frontend requirements. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final prd.md to your project's docs/ folder."

    - agent: ux-expert
      creates: front-end-spec.md
      requires: prd.md
      optional_steps:
        - user_research_prompt
      notes: "Creates UI/UX specification using front-end-spec-tmpl. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final front-end-spec.md to your project's docs/ folder."

    - agent: ux-expert
      creates: v0_prompt (optional)
      requires: front-end-spec.md
      condition: user_wants_ai_generation
      notes: "OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED: Generate AI UI prompt for tools like v0, Lovable, etc. Use the generate-ai-frontend-prompt task. User can then generate UI in external tool and download project structure."

    - agent: architect
      creates: front-end-architecture.md

      optional_steps:
        - technical_research_prompt
        - review_generated_ui_structure
      notes: "Creates frontend architecture using front-end-architecture-tmpl. If user generated UI with v0/Lovable, can incorporate the project structure into architecture. May suggest changes to PRD stories or new stories. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final front-end-architecture.md to your project's docs/ folder."

    - agent: pm
      updates: prd.md (if needed)
      requires: front-end-architecture.md

      uses: po-master-checklist
      notes: "Validates all documents for consistency and completeness. May require updates to any document."

    - agent: various
      updates: any_flagged_documents
      condition: po_checklist_issues
      notes: "If PO finds issues, return to relevant agent to fix and re-export updated documents to docs/ folder."

    - project_setup_guidance:
      action: guide_project_structure
      condition: user_has_generated_ui
      notes: "If user generated UI with v0/Lovable: For polyrepo setup, place downloaded project in separate frontend repo. For monorepo, place in apps/web or frontend/ directory. Review architecture document for specific guidance."

      action: move_to_ide
      notes: |
        Planning phase complete! Now transition to IDE Development:
        
        1. ENSURE DOCUMENTS ARE IN PROJECT:
           - Copy final prd.md to project's docs/prd.md
           - Copy final architecture.md to project's docs/architecture.md
           - All documents must be in the project before proceeding
        
        2. SHARD DOCUMENTS (in IDE):
           - Option A: Use PO agent to shard: @po then ask to shard docs/prd.md
           - Option B: Manual: Drag shard-doc task + docs/prd.md into chat
           - This creates docs/prd/ and docs/architecture/ folders with sharded content
        
        3. START DEVELOPMENT CYCLE:
           a. SM Agent (New Chat): @sm → *create
              - Creates next story from sharded docs
              - Review and approve story (Draft → Approved)
           
           b. Dev Agent (New Chat): @dev
              - Implements approved story
              - Updates File List with all changes
              - Marks story as "Review" when complete
           
           c. QA Agent (New Chat): @qa → review-story
              - Senior dev review with refactoring ability
              - Fixes small issues directly
              - Leaves checklist for remaining items
              - Updates story status (Review → Done or stays Review)
           
           d. If QA left unchecked items:
              - Dev Agent (New Chat): Address remaining items
              - Return to QA for final approval
        
        4. REPEAT: Continue cycle for all epic stories

    when_to_use:
      - Building production frontend applications
      - Multiple views/pages with complex interactions
      - Need comprehensive UI/UX design and testing
      - Multiple team members will be involved
      - Long-term maintenance expected
      - Customer-facing applications
