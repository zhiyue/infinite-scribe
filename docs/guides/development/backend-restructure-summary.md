# Backend Restructure Summary

## What Was Done

### 1. Created New Backend Structure
- Created `apps/backend/` directory with unified structure
- Organized code into:
  - `src/api/` - API Gateway module
  - `src/agents/` - All agent services (worldsmith, plotmaster, etc.)
  - `src/core/` - Core configuration and shared functionality
  - `src/common/` - Shared business logic

### 2. Configuration Files
- Created `apps/backend/pyproject.toml` with unified dependencies
- Created `apps/backend/Dockerfile` with parameterized service selection via `SERVICE_TYPE`
- Created `docker-compose.backend.yml` as an overlay for backend services

### 3. Updated Documentation
- Updated `docs/architecture/source-tree.md` to reflect new structure
- Updated `docs/development/python-dev-quickstart.md` with new commands and structure
- Created `docs/development/backend-structure-migration.md` as migration guide
- Created `apps/backend/README.md` for backend-specific documentation

### 4. Code Templates
- Created `src/agents/base.py` as base class for agents
- Created `src/agents/worldsmith/main.py` as example agent entry point
- Created basic API Gateway structure with health checks

### 5. Utility Scripts
- Created `scripts/cleanup-old-structure.sh` for removing old directories

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Simplified Dependency Management**: One `pyproject.toml` for all backend services
2. **Code Reuse**: Agents can easily share common functionality through `core` and `common` modules
3. **Easier Maintenance**: Single codebase to maintain instead of 10+ separate services
4. **Flexible Deployment**: Same Docker image can run different services via environment variable
5. **Development Efficiency**: No need to switch between multiple virtual environments

## How to Use

### Local Development
```bash
cd apps/backend
pip install -e .
uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload  # For API Gateway
python -m src.agents.worldsmith.main  # For agents
```

### Docker Deployment
```bash
docker build -t infinite-scribe-backend ./apps/backend
docker run -e SERVICE_TYPE=api-gateway infinite-scribe-backend
docker run -e SERVICE_TYPE=agent-worldsmith infinite-scribe-backend
```

### Docker Compose
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.backend.yml up
```

## Next Steps

1. Migrate actual service code to the new structure when ready
2. Update CI/CD pipelines to use new structure
3. Test deployment with new Docker configuration
4. Remove old directories using `scripts/cleanup-old-structure.sh`
