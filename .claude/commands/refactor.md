# Code Refactoring

1. **Check branch status** - Verify current branch and compare with main
2. **@code-simplifier** - Implement structural improvements and simplifications
3. **Test thoroughly** - Validate functionality is preserved using TDD approach, do not modify existing tests
4. **Git conventional commits** - Make atomic commits following conventional commit format
5. **Push changes** - Push refactored code to remote repository
