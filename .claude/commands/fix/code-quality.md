# Code Quality Fix

Use @code-reviewer to identify issues, then @code-simplifier to implement fixes for code quality, performance, and testing coverage focusing on naming conventions, algorithm efficiency, test completeness, and error handling patterns.

1. **@code-reviewer** - Analyze code quality issues
2. **Implement security fixes** - Address identified vulnerabilities
3. **@code-simplifier** - Implement fixes and refactoring
4. **Run tests** - Validate changes don't break functionality
5. **Commit and push** - Create descriptive commit message

For performance optimization changes, core algorithms, shared utilities, and test suite updates.
