# PRD: Server-Sent Events

## Executive Summary

Server-Sent Events (SSE) implementation for InfiniteScribe to provide real-time streaming of AI-generated content and progress notifications during long-running writing assistance operations. This feature addresses the critical need for immediate user feedback during "创世阶段" (genesis/creation phase) AI processes and other time-intensive operations, ensuring users remain engaged and informed throughout the writing process.

## Problem Statement

**Current State:**
- Users experience long wait times during AI content generation phases without feedback
- "创世阶段" iterations can take extended periods with no visibility into progress
- Generated AI content appears only after completion, creating poor UX during waiting periods
- No real-time notifications for system status, errors, or completion events
- Users may abandon sessions due to perceived system unresponsiveness

**Impact:**
- Reduced user engagement and potential session abandonment
- Uncertainty about system status leading to repeated requests
- Poor perceived performance despite actual system efficiency
- Missed opportunities for real-time collaborative features

**Why Now:**
- AI generation tasks are becoming more complex and time-intensive
- User expectations for real-time feedback in modern web applications
- Foundation needed for future collaborative writing features

## User Stories

### Primary User: Novel Writer

**Story 1: Real-time AI Writing Assistance**
- **As a** novel writer using AI assistance
- **I want to** see AI-generated content stream in real-time as it's being created
- **So that** I can review and potentially guide the generation process immediately
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - AI-generated text appears word-by-word or sentence-by-sentence as generated
  - User can see typing indicator when AI is actively generating
  - User can stop generation mid-process if needed
  - Generated content is visually distinguished from user input

**Story 2: Progress Tracking for Long Operations**
- **As a** writer initiating "创世阶段" world-building
- **I want to** receive real-time progress updates during each iteration
- **So that** I understand the system is working and estimate completion time
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Progress bar shows current stage and overall completion percentage
  - Status messages describe current operation (e.g., "Generating character backgrounds...")
  - Estimated time remaining updates dynamically
  - Clear indication when each iteration completes

**Story 3: System Status Awareness**
- **As a** writer working on my novel
- **I want to** be notified of system events and errors in real-time
- **So that** I can respond appropriately to system state changes
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Immediate notification of save operations completion
  - Real-time error alerts with suggested actions
  - Connection status indicators
  - Graceful handling of temporary disconnections

  - Granular progress updates (character creation, world building, plot development)
  - Dynamic progress estimation based on operation complexity
  - Stage completion notifications with results preview

#### Event Persistence & Recovery
- **Critical Event Storage**
  - Persist high-priority events (completed generations, errors, milestones)
  - Event replay capability for reconnecting users
  - Historical event querying for debugging and analytics
  - Configurable retention policies by event type

- **Connection Recovery**
  - Resume interrupted streams with missed event replay

- **Throughput:** Handle 10,000+ events per minute across all connections
- **Memory Usage:** < 1MB memory footprint per active connection

#### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling support across multiple backend instances
- Redis-based event broadcasting for multi-instance deployments
- Connection load balancing and distribution
- Event store scaling with database partitioning

#### Reliability
- **Availability:** 99.9% uptime for SSE endpoints
