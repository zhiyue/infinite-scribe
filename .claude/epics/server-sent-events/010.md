# Task: SSE Documentation & Monitoring

## Description

Create comprehensive documentation for the SSE system and implement monitoring/observability infrastructure. Provide API documentation, deployment guides, usage examples, and operational dashboards for SSE performance tracking and troubleshooting.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] API documentation covers all SSE endpoints with examples and schemas
- [ ] Developer guide explains SSE integration patterns and best practices
- [ ] Deployment guide provides step-by-step SSE setup and configuration
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards track SSE connection metrics and performance
- [ ] Alerting configured for SSE-specific error conditions and thresholds
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide covers common SSE issues and solutions
- [ ] Code documentation includes inline comments and type annotations
- [ ] Usage examples demonstrate real-world SSE implementation patterns

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for SSE endpoints
- **Monitoring Stack**: Integrate with existing monitoring infrastructure
- **Dashboard Creation**: Visual metrics for SSE health and performance
- **Documentation Site**: Comprehensive guides for developers and operators

### Code Locations/Files Affected
- `docs/api/sse/` - SSE API documentation and schemas
- `docs/guides/sse-integration.md` - Developer integration guide
- `docs/deployment/sse-setup.md` - SSE deployment and configuration
- `apps/backend/src/sse/monitoring.py` - SSE-specific metrics collection
- `monitoring/dashboards/sse-dashboard.json` - Grafana/monitoring dashboard
- `monitoring/alerts/sse-alerts.yml` - SSE alerting rules and thresholds

### Key Considerations
- **Documentation Maintenance**: Keep docs in sync with code changes
- **Monitoring Overhead**: Metrics collection shouldn't impact performance
- **Alert Accuracy**: Minimize false positives while catching real issues
- **User Experience**: Documentation should be clear and actionable

## Dependencies

- [ ] Can run parallel with all other tasks
- [ ] Existing monitoring infrastructure (Prometheus, Grafana, etc.)
- [ ] Documentation platform and standards
- [ ] API schema generation tools

## Effort Estimate

- **Size**: M (Medium - documentation and monitoring setup)
- **Hours**: 8-12 hours
- **Parallel**: true (can develop alongside all other tasks)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Complete API documentation with examples and schemas
- [ ] Developer integration guide with clear instructions
- [ ] Deployment guide tested with fresh environment setup
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards show relevant SSE metrics
- [ ] Alerting rules trigger appropriately for SSE issues
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide covers identified common issues
- [ ] All SSE code includes proper documentation comments
- [ ] Documentation reviewed for accuracy and completeness
