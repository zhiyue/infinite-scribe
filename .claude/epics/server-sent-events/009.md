# Task: SSE Performance Optimization

## Description

Optimize SSE system performance to meet production requirements including connection pooling, event batching, memory management, efficient event routing, and resource cleanup. Ensure system can handle 1000+ concurrent connections with minimal latency and resource usage.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Connection pooling reduces memory overhead to <1MB per active connection
- [ ] Event batching optimizes high-frequency event delivery without increasing latency
- [ ] Memory leak prevention with automatic cleanup of stale connections
- [ ] Event routing optimized to minimize CPU usage during high throughput
- [ ] Database query optimization for event persistence and replay
- [ ] Redis pub/sub performance tuning for multi-instance scaling
- [ ] Frontend event handling optimized for smooth UI updates
- [ ] Load testing validates 1000+ concurrent connections with <100ms latency

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient management of active SSE connections
- **Event Batching**: Group related events for efficient delivery
- **Resource Management**: Proactive cleanup and monitoring
- **Database Optimization**: Efficient queries and indexing for event operations

### Code Locations/Files Affected
- Update `apps/backend/src/sse/connection_manager.py` - Connection pooling and cleanup
- Update `apps/backend/src/sse/event_manager.py` - Event batching and routing optimization
- `apps/backend/src/sse/performance.py` - Performance monitoring and metrics
- Update `apps/backend/src/sse/event_store.py` - Database query optimization
- Update `apps/frontend/src/hooks/useSSEConnection.ts` - Frontend performance tuning
- Update Redis configuration for optimal pub/sub performance

### Key Considerations
- **Memory Efficiency**: Monitor and optimize memory usage patterns
- **CPU Optimization**: Minimize processing overhead for event handling
- **Network Efficiency**: Reduce bandwidth usage without losing functionality
- **Scalability Testing**: Validate performance under realistic load scenarios

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 001 - Backend SSE Infrastructure (base system to optimize)
- [ ] Task 003 - Event Persistence (database operations to optimize)  
- [ ] Task 004 - Redis Pub/Sub Setup (Redis operations to tune)
- [ ] Task 005 - Frontend SSE Integration (frontend performance to improve)
- [ ] Load testing tools and production-like environment

## Effort Estimate

- **Size**: M (Medium - optimization work)
- **Hours**: 10-14 hours
- **Parallel**: false (requires completed SSE components to optimize)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Connection pooling reduces per-connection memory usage
- [ ] Event batching improves throughput without increasing latency
- [ ] Memory leak testing shows proper resource cleanup
- [ ] Load testing demonstrates 1000+ concurrent connections
- [ ] Event latency consistently <100ms under normal load
- [ ] Database queries optimized with proper indexing
- [ ] Redis pub/sub performance tuned for production load
- [ ] Performance monitoring and alerting implemented
- [ ] Optimization results documented with before/after metrics
