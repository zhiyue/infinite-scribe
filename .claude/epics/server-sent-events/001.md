# Task: Backend SSE Infrastructure

## Description

Implement the core backend Server-Sent Events infrastructure including SSE endpoints, connection management, event system, and basic event types. This foundational task establishes the SSE communication layer that all other SSE features will build upon.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] SSE endpoint (`/api/sse/stream`) responds with proper `text/event-stream` content-type
- [ ] Connection manager tracks active SSE connections with user session mapping
- [ ] Event manager provides centralized event publishing and routing
- [ ] Typed event system supports multiple event types (ai-generation, progress, system-status, error)
- [ ] Basic connection health monitoring and heartbeat mechanism
- [ ] SSE connections properly close on client disconnect
- [ ] Event validation and serialization works correctly
- [ ] Basic error handling for malformed events and connection failures

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach
- **FastAPI StreamingResponse**: Use native SSE support with async generators
- **Connection Pool Pattern**: Maintain active connections in memory with user mapping
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Centralized event manager with typed events
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper cleanup of connections and resources

### Code Locations/Files Affected
- Create `apps/backend/src/sse/` directory structure
- `apps/backend/src/sse/sse_router.py` - FastAPI SSE endpoint router
- `apps/backend/src/sse/connection_manager.py` - Connection tracking and lifecycle
- `apps/backend/src/sse/event_manager.py` - Event publishing and routing logic
- `apps/backend/src/sse/events.py` - Event type definitions and schemas
- `apps/backend/src/sse/__init__.py` - Module exports and initialization
- Update `apps/backend/src/main.py` to include SSE router

### Key Considerations
- **Memory Management**: Ensure connections are properly cleaned up
- **Async Handling**: Use asyncio for non-blocking event streaming
- **Error Isolation**: Individual connection failures shouldn't affect others
- **Event Buffering**: Basic event queuing for immediate delivery

## Dependencies

- [ ] FastAPI framework (existing)
- [ ] Pydantic for event schema validation (existing)
- [ ] Python asyncio for async SSE streaming
- [ ] JSON serialization for event data

## Effort Estimate

- **Size**: L (Large - foundational component)
- **Hours**: 16-20 hours
- **Parallel**: false (foundational - blocks other SSE tasks)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Code implemented following project patterns
- [ ] Unit tests written for connection manager and event system
- [ ] Integration test verifies SSE endpoint functionality
- [ ] Documentation added for SSE event types and usage
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] SSE endpoint accessible and responds to basic connections
- [ ] Event publishing and delivery pipeline functional
