# Task: SSE Testing & Quality Assurance

## Description

Develop comprehensive testing suite for SSE functionality including unit tests, integration tests, load tests, and end-to-end scenarios. Ensure SSE system reliability, performance, and proper error handling across all components and usage scenarios.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Unit tests cover all SSE components (connection manager, event system, hooks)
- [ ] Integration tests verify SSE endpoint behavior and Redis pub/sub functionality
- [ ] Load tests validate concurrent connection limits and event throughput
- [ ] E2E tests cover complete user journeys with AI streaming and progress tracking
- [ ] Security tests verify authentication and rate limiting effectiveness
- [ ] Connection reliability tests simulate network failures and recovery
- [ ] Memory leak tests ensure proper resource cleanup
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing for EventSource support
- [ ] Test coverage >90% for all SSE-related code

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach
- **Unit Testing**: Component-level tests with mocking for external dependencies
- **Integration Testing**: Real SSE connections with test databases and Redis
- **Load Testing**: Concurrent connection simulation with performance metrics
- **E2E Testing**: Browser automation testing complete user workflows

### Code Locations/Files Affected
- `apps/backend/tests/sse/` - Backend SSE unit and integration tests
- `apps/frontend/src/__tests__/sse/` - Frontend SSE component tests
- `tests/e2e/sse/` - End-to-end SSE user journey tests
- `tests/load/sse-load-test.py` - Load testing scripts and scenarios
- `apps/backend/tests/conftest.py` - SSE test fixtures and utilities

### Key Considerations
- **Test Isolation**: Each test should not affect others (connection cleanup)
- **Realistic Scenarios**: Tests should mirror actual user behavior patterns
- **Performance Baseline**: Establish benchmarks for latency and throughput
- **Error Simulation**: Test various failure modes and recovery scenarios

## Dependencies

- [ ] Testing can run parallel with all development tasks
- [ ] Test databases and Redis instances for integration testing
- [ ] Load testing tools (pytest, locust, or similar)
- [ ] E2E testing framework (Playwright, Selenium)

## Effort Estimate

- **Size**: L (Large - comprehensive testing coverage)
- **Hours**: 16-20 hours
- **Parallel**: true (can develop tests alongside features)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All unit tests pass with >90% code coverage
- [ ] Integration tests verify SSE functionality end-to-end
- [ ] Load tests demonstrate performance benchmarks are met
- [ ] E2E tests cover primary user workflows
- [ ] Security tests validate authentication and rate limiting
- [ ] Connection reliability tests pass under simulated failures
- [ ] Memory leak tests show proper resource cleanup
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline includes all SSE tests
- [ ] Test documentation provides clear usage examples
