# Task: Authentication & Security for SSE

## Description

Implement authentication and security measures for Server-Sent Events endpoints, including JWT token validation, rate limiting, CORS configuration, and event content sanitization. Ensure SSE connections are secure and protected against abuse while integrating with existing authentication systems.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] SSE endpoint validates JWT tokens from existing authentication system
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents SSE connection abuse (max connections per user)
- [ ] CORS configuration allows proper cross-origin SSE requests
- [ ] Event content sanitization prevents XSS and malicious payloads
- [ ] Connection authorization based on user permissions and roles
- [ ] Secure handling of authentication failures with proper error responses
- [ ] Rate limiting for event publishing to prevent spam
- [ ] Audit logging for SSE authentication events

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach
- **JWT Integration**: Reuse existing JWT middleware for SSE endpoint authentication
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement per-user connection limits and event frequency controls
- **Content Security**: Sanitize event data and validate against known schemas
- **CORS Policy**: Configure appropriate headers for frontend SSE access

### Code Locations/Files Affected
- `apps/backend/src/sse/auth.py` - SSE-specific authentication middleware
- `apps/backend/src/sse/security.py` - Rate limiting and content sanitization
- `apps/backend/src/sse/sse_router.py` - Apply auth/security middleware to endpoints
- Update `apps/backend/src/config/cors.py` for SSE-specific CORS rules
- `apps/backend/src/sse/validators.py` - Event content validation schemas

### Key Considerations
- **Performance Impact**: Authentication checks shouldn't significantly impact SSE latency
- **Graceful Degradation**: Handle auth failures without breaking existing connections
- **Security Headers**: Proper SSE-specific security headers and policies
- **Token Refresh**: Handle JWT token expiration during long-lived SSE connections

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 001 - Backend SSE Infrastructure (SSE endpoints must exist)
- [ ] Existing JWT authentication system integration
- [ ] Rate limiting middleware (Redis-based preferred)
- [ ] Content sanitization libraries (bleach, validator)

## Effort Estimate

- **Size**: M (Medium - security integration)
- **Hours**: 10-12 hours
- **Parallel**: true (can develop alongside core SSE infrastructure)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] JWT authentication integrated with SSE endpoints
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented and tested under load
- [ ] CORS configuration allows frontend SSE connections
- [ ] Event content validation prevents malicious payloads
- [ ] Security tests written covering auth edge cases
- [ ] Authentication failures logged and monitored
- [ ] Code reviewed with security focus
- [ ] Integration tested with existing auth system
