# Task: Frontend SSE Integration

## Description

Implement React frontend SSE integration including EventSource management, custom hooks for SSE connections, type-safe event handling, and automatic reconnection logic. Provide the foundation for real-time UI updates through SSE event streams.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `useSSEConnection` hook manages EventSource with automatic reconnection
- [ ] `useEventSubscription` hook provides type-safe event filtering and handling
- [ ] `SSEProvider` context distributes SSE connection state globally
- [ ] EventSource properly authenticates using existing JWT tokens
- [ ] Connection status indicators show SSE health (connected/disconnected/reconnecting)
- [ ] Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff strategy
- [ ] Error boundaries handle SSE failures gracefully
- [ ] Event deduplication prevents duplicate processing
- [ ] TypeScript types for all SSE events and handlers

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach
- **EventSource API**: Browser-native SSE client with custom React hooks
- **React Context**: Global SSE state management and event distribution
- **TypeScript Integration**: Strongly typed event system with proper interfaces
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and user-friendly error states

### Code Locations/Files Affected
- `apps/frontend/src/hooks/useSSEConnection.ts` - Core SSE connection management
- `apps/frontend/src/hooks/useEventSubscription.ts` - Event filtering and handling
- `apps/frontend/src/contexts/SSEContext.tsx` - Global SSE state provider
- `apps/frontend/src/types/sse.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for SSE events
- `apps/frontend/src/components/SSEStatus.tsx` - Connection status indicator
- `apps/frontend/src/utils/sseClient.ts` - EventSource wrapper utilities

### Key Considerations
- **JWT Token Integration**: Include auth headers in SSE requests
- **Reconnection Strategy**: Exponential backoff with maximum retry limits
- **Memory Leaks**: Proper cleanup of EventSource connections and listeners
- **Performance**: Efficient event filtering and handler management

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 001 - Backend SSE Infrastructure (SSE endpoint must be available)
- [ ] Task 002 - Authentication & Security (JWT integration required)
- [ ] Existing React context patterns and hooks architecture
- [ ] TypeScript configuration for strict event typing

## Effort Estimate

- **Size**: L (Large - core frontend integration)
- **Hours**: 14-16 hours
- **Parallel**: false (depends on backend SSE and auth completion)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] SSE connection hook successfully connects to backend
- [ ] Event subscription hook receives and filters events correctly
- [ ] JWT authentication works with EventSource requests
- [ ] Automatic reconnection tested under various failure scenarios
- [ ] Connection status accurately reflects SSE health
- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes with strict event typing
- [ ] Error boundaries handle all SSE failure modes
- [ ] Integration tests verify frontend-backend SSE communication
- [ ] Memory leak testing confirms proper cleanup
