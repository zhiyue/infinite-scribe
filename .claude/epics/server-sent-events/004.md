# Task: Redis Pub/Sub for SSE Scaling

## Description

Implement Redis pub/sub event broadcasting to enable SSE scaling across multiple backend instances. Allow events generated on any backend instance to be delivered to SSE connections on any other instance, supporting horizontal scaling and load balancing.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Redis pub/sub channels configured for SSE event broadcasting
- [ ] Events published to Redis automatically distribute to all backend instances
- [ ] SSE connections receive events regardless of which instance generated them
- [ ] Channel naming convention supports event routing and filtering
- [ ] Redis connection pooling and error handling for pub/sub operations
- [ ] Event serialization/deserialization for Redis transport
- [ ] Monitoring and metrics for pub/sub performance and reliability
- [ ] Graceful handling of Redis unavailability with local fallback

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach
- **Redis Pub/Sub Channels**: Event-type-specific channels for efficient routing
- **Event Broadcasting**: Publish events to Redis, subscribe on all instances
- **Connection Mapping**: Track which instance handles which SSE connections
- **Fallback Strategy**: Local event delivery when Redis unavailable

### Code Locations/Files Affected
- `apps/backend/src/sse/redis_publisher.py` - Redis pub/sub event publishing
- `apps/backend/src/sse/redis_subscriber.py` - Redis event subscription and handling
- Update `apps/backend/src/sse/event_manager.py` to integrate Redis broadcasting
- `apps/backend/src/config/redis.py` - Redis pub/sub configuration
- `apps/backend/src/sse/channels.py` - Channel naming and routing logic

### Key Considerations
- **Performance**: Redis pub/sub should not introduce significant latency
- **Reliability**: Handle Redis connection failures gracefully
- **Scaling**: Support dynamic addition/removal of backend instances
- **Channel Design**: Efficient event routing without overwhelming Redis

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 001 - Backend SSE Infrastructure (event system integration)
- [ ] Existing Redis infrastructure and configuration
- [ ] Redis pub/sub capabilities enabled in current setup
- [ ] Event serialization format compatible across instances

## Effort Estimate

- **Size**: M (Medium - Redis integration)
- **Hours**: 10-12 hours
- **Parallel**: true (independent of other SSE components)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Redis pub/sub channels operational and tested
- [ ] Events broadcast correctly across multiple backend instances
- [ ] SSE connections receive events from any backend instance
- [ ] Redis connection failures handled gracefully
- [ ] Load testing validates multi-instance event delivery
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting for Redis pub/sub health
- [ ] Documentation for Redis channel conventions
- [ ] Integration tests verify cross-instance event flow
