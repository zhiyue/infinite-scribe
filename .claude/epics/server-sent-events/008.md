# Task: Real-time UI/UX Components

## Description

Develop user interface components for displaying real-time SSE events including AI text streaming displays, progress bars, typing indicators, connection status indicators, and error boundaries. Create intuitive and engaging real-time user experiences for AI writing assistance.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Real-time text display component streams AI-generated content word-by-word
- [ ] Typing indicator shows when AI is actively generating content
- [ ] Multi-stage progress bars for "创世阶段" operations with status messages
- [ ] Connection status indicator clearly shows SSE health (connected/reconnecting/disconnected)
- [ ] Error boundaries gracefully handle SSE failures with user-friendly messages
- [ ] Generation stop/cancel controls for interrupting AI operations
- [ ] Status notifications for system events (save complete, errors, milestones)
- [ ] Visual distinction between AI-generated and user-input content
- [ ] Responsive design works on various screen sizes

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach
- **Component Architecture**: Reusable React components with SSE hooks integration
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators for real-time states and transitions
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error states with actionable recovery options
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and screen reader support

### Code Locations/Files Affected
- `apps/frontend/src/components/sse/` - SSE-specific UI components directory
- `apps/frontend/src/components/sse/StreamingText.tsx` - Real-time text display
- `apps/frontend/src/components/sse/TypingIndicator.tsx` - AI typing animation
- `apps/frontend/src/components/sse/ProgressBar.tsx` - Multi-stage progress display
- `apps/frontend/src/components/sse/ConnectionStatus.tsx` - SSE connection indicator
- `apps/frontend/src/components/sse/SSEErrorBoundary.tsx` - Error handling wrapper
- `apps/frontend/src/components/sse/GenerationControls.tsx` - Stop/cancel controls

### Key Considerations
- **Performance**: Efficient rendering of frequent real-time updates
- **User Experience**: Smooth animations and clear visual feedback
- **Accessibility**: Support for users with disabilities
- **Error Recovery**: Clear paths for users to recover from failures

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 005 - Frontend SSE Integration (SSE hooks required)
- [ ] Task 007 - AI Service Integration (AI events to display)
- [ ] Existing React component patterns and design system
- [ ] CSS/styling framework integration

## Effort Estimate

- **Size**: M (Medium - UI component development)
- **Hours**: 12-15 hours
- **Parallel**: false (depends on SSE frontend integration and AI integration)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All real-time UI components implemented and styled
- [ ] Components integrate properly with SSE hooks and events
- [ ] Typing indicators and progress bars provide smooth user feedback
- [ ] Connection status accurately reflects SSE health
- [ ] Error boundaries handle all SSE failure scenarios gracefully
- [ ] Components are responsive and accessible
- [ ] User testing confirms intuitive and engaging experience
- [ ] Component documentation and usage examples provided
