## Development Progress

### âœ… Completed Areas

- **Comprehensive Architecture Documentation**: Complete docs/architecture/ with 18+ detailed specifications
- **Event-Driven Architecture Design**: Full Kafka-based messaging system with CQRS and Event Sourcing patterns
- **Multi-Agent System Specification**: 10 specialized AI agents with defined roles and communication patterns
- **Infrastructure Foundation**: Docker compose with 7 core services (Kafka, PostgreSQL, Redis, Neo4j, Milvus, MinIO, Prefect)
- **Backend Unified Architecture**: Single codebase approach with SERVICE_TYPE environment variable
- **Development Tooling**: Complete script system, pnpm workspaces, parameterized commands
- **Technology Stack**: Comprehensive tech stack with specific versions (React 18.2.0, FastAPI 0.115.13, Kafka 3.7.0, etc.)
- **Development Guidelines**: CLAUDE.md with comprehensive development standards and workflows
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions, pre-commit hooks, automated testing framework

### ðŸ”„ In Progress

- **API Gateway Implementation**: FastAPI-based gateway with command/query separation
- **Agent Service Development**: Individual agent microservices with Kafka integration
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Prefect-based multi-step novel generation workflows
- **Knowledge Base Integration**: Neo4j graph database for relationships, Milvus for vector search
- **Frontend Architecture**: React + Zustand + TanStack Query implementation

### ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

1. **MVP Implementation**: Focus on core genesis and chapter generation workflows
2. **Agent Communication**: Implement Kafka event bus with message relay service
3. **Database Schema**: Deploy PostgreSQL tables with event sourcing and CQRS patterns
4. **Genesis Interface**: Build initial UI for world creation and novel initialization
5. **Agent Coordination**: Implement basic workflow with 3-4 core agents (Worldsmith, Outliner, Writer, Critic)

## Development Environment Status

- **Infrastructure Services**: 7 core services via Docker Compose
  - PostgreSQL 16 (main database with event sourcing tables)
  - Redis 7.2 (caching and callback handling)
  - Apache Kafka 3.7.0 (central event bus)
  - Neo4j 5.x (knowledge graph for relationships)
  - Milvus 2.4.0 (vector database for semantic search)
  - MinIO (S3-compatible object storage)
  - Prefect 2.19.0 (workflow orchestration)
- **Service Endpoints**: All services exposed on dev server (192.168.2.201)
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Multi-environment setup (dev, test, prod)
- **Development Tools**: Unified parameterized command system via pnpm scripts

## Key Achievements

- **Architectural Excellence**: Comprehensive event-driven microservices architecture with sophisticated patterns (CQRS, Event Sourcing, Transactional Outbox)
- **Multi-Agent Innovation**: World's first 10-agent collaborative novel generation system with specialized roles
- **Technology Integration**: Successfully integrated complex tech stack (Kafka, Prefect, Neo4j, Milvus) with clear documentation
- **Development Standards**: Established rigorous quality standards with automated testing and CI/CD
- **Monorepo Maturity**: Robust workspace management with shared dependencies and unified build system
- **Knowledge Management**: Comprehensive documentation system covering all architectural aspects

## Recent Context Integration (2025-08-28)

- **Architecture Documentation**: Analyzed and integrated 18+ architecture documents from docs/architecture/
- **Context File Updates**: Updated 4 core context files with comprehensive system details
- **Technology Stack**: Integrated complete tech stack with specific versions and integration patterns  
- **Multi-Agent Details**: Added detailed specifications for all 10 AI agents and their coordination patterns
- **Event-Driven Patterns**: Documented sophisticated messaging patterns and workflow orchestration

## Current Focus

The project has evolved from general AI-assisted writing to a sophisticated multi-agent novel generation platform. Current focus areas include:

1. **MVP Implementation**: Building core event-driven workflows for automated novel generation
2. **Agent Integration**: Implementing the 10-agent system with Kafka-based communication
3. **Workflow Orchestration**: Developing Prefect-based pause/resume workflows for complex multi-step processes
4. **Knowledge Base**: Integrating Neo4j graph database and Milvus vector search for narrative consistency
