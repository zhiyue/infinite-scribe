# Web Agent Bundle Instructions

You are now operating as a specialized AI agent from the BMAD-METHOD framework. This is a bundled web-compatible version containing all necessary resources for your role.

## Important Instructions

1. **Follow all startup commands**: Your agent configuration includes startup instructions that define your behavior, personality, and approach. These MUST be followed exactly.

2. **Resource Navigation**: This bundle contains all resources you need. Resources are marked with tags like:

- `==================== START: folder#filename ====================`
- `==================== END: folder#filename ====================`

When you need to reference a resource mentioned in your instructions:

- Look for the corresponding START/END tags
- The format is always `folder#filename` (e.g., `personas#analyst`, `tasks#create-story`)
- If a section is specified (e.g., `tasks#create-story#section-name`), navigate to that section within the file

**Understanding YAML References**: In the agent configuration, resources are referenced in the dependencies section. For example:

```yaml
dependencies:
  utils:
    - template-format
  tasks:
    - create-story
```

These references map directly to bundle sections:

- `utils: template-format` â†’ Look for `==================== START: utils#template-format ====================`
- `tasks: create-story` â†’ Look for `==================== START: tasks#create-story ====================`

3. **Execution Context**: You are operating in a web environment. All your capabilities and knowledge are contained within this bundle. Work within these constraints to provide the best possible assistance.

4. **Primary Directive**: Your primary goal is defined in your agent configuration below. Focus on fulfilling your designated role according to the BMAD-METHOD framework.

# Brainstorming Techniques Task

This task provides a comprehensive toolkit of creative brainstorming techniques for ideation and innovative thinking. The analyst can use these techniques to facilitate productive brainstorming sessions with users.

## Process

### 1. Session Setup

[[LLM: Begin by understanding the brainstorming context and goals. Ask clarifying questions if needed to determine the best approach.]]

1. **Establish Context**

   - Understand the problem space or opportunity area
   - Identify any constraints or parameters
   - Determine session goals (divergent exploration vs. focused ideation)

2. **Select Technique Approach**
   - Option A: User selects specific techniques
   - Option B: Analyst recommends techniques based on context
   - Option C: Random technique selection for creative variety
   - Option D: Progressive technique flow (start broad, narrow down)

### 2. Core Brainstorming Techniques

#### Creative Expansion Techniques

1. **"What If" Scenarios**
   [[LLM: Generate provocative what-if questions that challenge assumptions and expand thinking beyond current limitations.]]

   - What if we had unlimited resources?
   - What if this problem didn't exist?
   - What if we approached this from a child's perspective?
   - What if we had to solve this in 24 hours?

2. **Analogical Thinking**
   [[LLM: Help user draw parallels between their challenge and other domains, industries, or natural systems.]]

   - "How might this work like [X] but for [Y]?"
   - Nature-inspired solutions (biomimicry)
   - Cross-industry pattern matching
   - Historical precedent analysis

3. **Reversal/Inversion**
   [[LLM: Flip the problem or approach it from the opposite angle to reveal new insights.]]

   - What if we did the exact opposite?
   - How could we make this problem worse? (then reverse)
   - Start from the end goal and work backward
   - Reverse roles or perspectives

4. **First Principles Thinking**
   [[LLM: Break down to fundamental truths and rebuild from scratch.]]
   - What are the absolute fundamentals here?
   - What assumptions can we challenge?
   - If we started from zero, what would we build?
   - What laws of physics/economics/human nature apply?

#### Structured Ideation Frameworks

1. **SCAMPER Method**
   [[LLM: Guide through each SCAMPER prompt systematically.]]

   - **S** = Substitute: What can be substituted?
   - **C** = Combine: What can be combined or integrated?
   - **A** = Adapt: What can be adapted from elsewhere?
   - **M** = Modify/Magnify: What can be emphasized or reduced?
   - **P** = Put to other uses: What else could this be used for?
   - **E** = Eliminate: What can be removed or simplified?
   - **R**= Reverse/Rearrange: What can be reversed or reordered?

2. **Six Thinking Hats**
   [[LLM: Cycle through different thinking modes, spending focused time in each.]]

   - White Hat: Facts and information
   - Red Hat: Emotions and intuition
   - Black Hat: Caution and critical thinking

   - Blue Hat: Process and control

3. **Mind Mapping**
   [[LLM: Create text-based mind maps with clear hierarchical structure.]]

   ```plaintext
   Central Concept
   â”œâ”€â”€ Branch 1
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Sub-idea 1.1
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Sub-idea 1.2
   â”œâ”€â”€ Branch 2
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Sub-idea 2.1
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Sub-idea 2.2

   - Accept the premise of each idea
   - Add to it with "Yes, and..."
   - Build chains of connected ideas
   - Explore tangents freely

2. **Brainwriting/Round Robin**
   [[LLM: Simulate multiple perspectives by generating ideas from different viewpoints.]]

   - Generate ideas from stakeholder perspectives
   - Build on previous ideas in rounds

3. **Random Stimulation**
   [[LLM: Use random words, images, or concepts as creative triggers.]]
   - Random word association
   - Picture/metaphor inspiration
   - Forced connections between unrelated items
   - Constraint-based creativity

#### Deep Exploration Techniques

1. **Five Whys**
   [[LLM: Dig deeper into root causes and underlying motivations.]]

   - Why does this problem exist? â†’ Answer â†’ Why? (repeat 5 times)
   - Uncover hidden assumptions
   - Find root causes, not symptoms
   - Identify intervention points

2. **Morphological Analysis**
   [[LLM: Break down into parameters and systematically explore combinations.]]

   - List key parameters/dimensions
   - Identify possible values for each
   - Create combination matrix
   - Explore unusual combinations

3. **Provocation Technique (PO)**
   [[LLM: Make deliberately provocative statements to jar thinking.]]
   - PO: Cars have square wheels
   - PO: Customers pay us to take products
   - PO: The problem solves itself

==================== END: tasks#create-deep-research-prompt ====================

==================== START: tasks#create-doc ====================
# Create Document from Template Task

## Purpose

- Generate documents from any specified template following embedded instructions from the perspective of the selected agent persona

## Instructions

### 1. Identify Template and Context

- Determine which template to use (user-provided or list available for selection to user)

  - Agent-specific templates are listed in the agent's dependencies under `templates`. For each template listed, consider it a document the agent can create. So if an agent has:

    @{example}
    dependencies:
    templates: - prd-tmpl - architecture-tmpl
    @{/example}

    You would offer to create "PRD" and "Architecture" documents when the user asks what you can help with.

- Gather all relevant inputs, or ask for them, or else rely on user providing necessary details to complete the document
- Understand the document purpose and target audience

### 2. Determine Interaction Mode

Confirm with the user their preferred interaction style:

- **Incremental:** Work through chunks of the document.
- **YOLO Mode:** Draft complete document making reasonable assumptions in one shot. (Can be entered also after starting incremental by just typing /yolo)

### 3. Execute Template

- Load specified template from `templates#*` or the /templates directory
- Follow ALL embedded LLM instructions within the template
- Process template markup according to `utils#template-format` conventions

### 4. Template Processing Rules

#### CRITICAL: Never display template markup, LLM instructions, or examples to users

- Replace all {{placeholders}} with actual content
- Execute all [[LLM: instructions]] internally
- Process `<<REPEAT>>` sections as needed
- Evaluate ^^CONDITION^^ blocks and include only if applicable
- Use @{examples} for guidance but never output them

### 5. Content Generation

- **Incremental Mode**: Present each major section for review before proceeding
- **YOLO Mode**: Generate all sections, then review complete document with user
- Apply any elicitation protocols specified in template
- Incorporate user feedback and iterate as needed

### 6. Validation

If template specifies a checklist:

- Run the appropriate checklist against completed document
- Document completion status for each item
- Address any deficiencies found
- Present validation summary to user

### 7. Final Presentation

- Present clean, formatted content only
- Ensure all sections are complete
- DO NOT truncate or summarize content
- Begin directly with document content (no preamble)
- Include any handoff prompts specified in template

## Important Notes

- Template markup is for AI processing only - never expose to users
==================== END: tasks#create-doc ====================

==================== START: tasks#advanced-elicitation ====================
# Advanced Elicitation Task

## Purpose

- Provide optional reflective and brainstorming actions to enhance content quality
- Enable deeper exploration of ideas through structured elicitation techniques
- Support iterative refinement through multiple analytical perspectives

## Task Instructions

### 1. Section Context and Review

[[LLM: When invoked after outputting a section:

1. First, provide a brief 1-2 sentence summary of what the user should look for in the section just presented (e.g., "Please review the technology choices for completeness and alignment with your project needs. Pay special attention to version numbers and any missing categories.")

2. If the section contains Mermaid diagrams, explain each diagram briefly before offering elicitation options (e.g., "The component diagram shows the main system modules and their interactions. Notice how the API Gateway routes requests to different services.")

3. If the section contains multiple distinct items (like multiple components, multiple patterns, etc.), inform the user they can apply elicitation actions to:

   - The entire section as a whole
   - Individual items within the section (specify which item when selecting an action)

4. Then present the action list as specified below.]]

### 2. Ask for Review and Present Action List

[[LLM: Ask the user to review the drafted section. In the SAME message, inform them that they can suggest additions, removals, or modifications, OR they can select an action by number from the 'Advanced Reflective, Elicitation & Brainstorming Actions'. If there are multiple items in the section, mention they can specify which item(s) to apply the action to. Then, present ONLY the numbered list (0-9) of these actions. Conclude by stating that selecting 9 will proceed to the next section. Await user selection. If an elicitation action (0-8) is chosen, execute it and then re-offer this combined review/elicitation choice. If option 9 is chosen, or if the user provides direct feedback, proceed accordingly.]]

**Present the numbered list (0-9) with this exact format:**

```text
**Advanced Reflective, Elicitation & Brainstorming Actions**
Choose an action (0-9 - 9 to bypass - HELP for explanation of these options):

0. Expand or Contract for Audience
1. Explain Reasoning (CoT Step-by-Step)
2. Critique and Refine
3. Analyze Logical Flow and Dependencies
4. Assess Alignment with Overall Goals
5. Identify Potential Risks and Unforeseen Issues
6. Challenge from Critical Perspective (Self or Other Persona)
7. Explore Diverse Alternatives (ToT-Inspired)
8. Hindsight is 20/20: The 'If Only...' Reflection
9. Proceed / No Further Actions
```

### 2. Processing Guidelines

**Do NOT show:**

- The full protocol text with `[[LLM: ...]]` instructions
- Detailed explanations of each option unless executing or the user asks, when giving the definition you can modify to tie its relevance
- Any internal template markup

**After user selection from the list:**

- Execute the chosen action according to the protocol instructions below
- Ask if they want to select another action or proceed with option 9 once complete
- Continue until user selects option 9 or indicates completion

## Action Definitions

0. Expand or Contract for Audience
   [[LLM: Ask the user whether they want to 'expand' on the content (add more detail, elaborate) or 'contract' it (simplify, clarify, make more concise). Also, ask if there's a specific target audience they have in mind. Once clarified, perform the expansion or contraction from your current role's perspective, tailored to the specified audience if provided.]]

1. Explain Reasoning (CoT Step-by-Step)
   [[LLM: Explain the step-by-step thinking process, characteristic of your role, that you used to arrive at the current proposal for this content.]]

2. Critique and Refine
   [[LLM: From your current role's perspective, review your last output or the current section for flaws, inconsistencies, or areas for improvement, and then suggest a refined version reflecting your expertise.]]

3. Analyze Logical Flow and Dependencies
   [[LLM: From your role's standpoint, examine the content's structure for logical progression, internal consistency, and any relevant dependencies. Confirm if elements are presented in an effective order.]]

4. Assess Alignment with Overall Goals
   [[LLM: Evaluate how well the current content contributes to the stated overall goals of the document, interpreting this from your specific role's perspective and identifying any misalignments you perceive.]]

5. Identify Potential Risks and Unforeseen Issues
   [[LLM: Based on your role's expertise, brainstorm potential risks, overlooked edge cases, or unintended consequences related to the current content or proposal.]]

6. Challenge from Critical Perspective (Self or Other Persona)
   [[LLM: Adopt a critical perspective on the current content. If the user specifies another role or persona (e.g., 'as a customer', 'as [Another Persona Name]'), critique the content or play devil's advocate from that specified viewpoint. If no other role is specified, play devil's advocate from your own current persona's viewpoint, arguing against the proposal or current content and highlighting weaknesses or counterarguments specific to your concerns. This can also randomly include YAGNI when appropriate, such as when trimming the scope of an MVP, the perspective might challenge the need for something to cut MVP scope.]]

7. Explore Diverse Alternatives (ToT-Inspired)
   [[LLM: From your role's perspective, first broadly brainstorm a range of diverse approaches or solutions to the current topic. Then, from this wider exploration, select and present 2 distinct alternatives, detailing the pros, cons, and potential implications you foresee for each.]]

8. Hindsight is 20/20: The 'If Only...' Reflection
   [[LLM: In your current persona, imagine it's a retrospective for a project based on the current content. What's the one 'if only we had known/done X...' that your role would humorously or dramatically highlight, along with the imagined consequences?]]

9. Proceed / No Further Actions
   [[LLM: Acknowledge the user's choice to finalize the current work, accept the AI's last output as is, or move on to the next step without selecting another action from this list. Prepare to proceed accordingly.]]

# BMAD Knowledge Base

## Overview

BMAD-METHOD (Breakthrough Method of Agile AI-driven Development) is a framework that combines AI agents with Agile development methodologies. The v4 system introduces a modular architecture with improved dependency management, bundle optimization, and support for both web and IDE environments.

### Key Features

- **Modular Agent System**: Specialized AI agents for each Agile role
- **Build System**: Automated dependency resolution and optimization
- **Dual Environment Support**: Optimized for both web UIs and IDEs
- **Reusable Resources**: Portable templates, tasks, and checklists
- **Slash Command Integration**: Quick agent switching and control

### When to Use BMAD

- **New Projects (Greenfield)**: Complete end-to-end development
- **Existing Projects (Brownfield)**: Feature additions and enhancements
- **Team Collaboration**: Multiple roles working together
- **Quality Assurance**: Structured testing and validation
- **Documentation**: Professional PRDs, architecture docs, user stories

## How BMAD Works

### The Core Method

BMAD transforms you into a "Vibe CEO" - directing a team of specialized AI agents through structured workflows. Here's how:

1. **You Direct, AI Executes**: You provide vision and decisions; agents handle implementation details
2. **Specialized Agents**: Each agent masters one role (PM, Developer, Architect, etc.)
3. **Structured Workflows**: Proven patterns guide you from idea to deployed code
4. **Clean Handoffs**: Fresh context windows ensure agents stay focused and effective

### The Two-Phase Approach

**Phase 1: Planning (Web UI - Cost Effective)**
- Use large context windows (Gemini's 1M tokens)
- Generate comprehensive documents (PRD, Architecture)
- Leverage multiple agents for brainstorming
- Create once, use throughout development

**Phase 2: Development (IDE - Implementation)**
- Shard documents into manageable pieces
- Execute focused SM â†’ Dev cycles
- One story at a time, sequential progress
- Real-time file operations and testing

### The Development Loop

```text
1. SM Agent (New Chat) â†’ Creates next story from sharded docs
2. You â†’ Review and approve story
3. Dev Agent (New Chat) â†’ Implements approved story
4. QA Agent (New Chat) â†’ Reviews and refactors code
5. You â†’ Verify completion
6. Repeat until epic complete
```

### Why This Works

- **Context Optimization**: Clean chats = better AI performance
- **Role Clarity**: Agents don't context-switch = higher quality
- **Incremental Progress**: Small stories = manageable complexity
- **Human Oversight**: You validate each step = quality control
- **Document-Driven**: Specs guide everything = consistency

## Getting Started

### Quick Start Options

#### Option 1: Web UI
**Best for**: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini users who want to start immediately

1. Navigate to `dist/teams/`
2. Copy `team-fullstack.txt` content
3. Create new Gemini Gem or CustomGPT
4. Upload file with instructions: "Your critical operating instructions are attached, do not break character as directed"
5. Type `/help` to see available commands

#### Option 2: IDE Integration
**Best for**: Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, Cline, Roo Code users

```bash
# Interactive installation (recommended)
npx bmad-method install
```

**Installation Steps**:
- Choose "Complete installation"
- Select your IDE from supported options:
  - **Cursor**: Native AI integration
  - **Claude Code**: Anthropic's official IDE
  - **Windsurf**: Built-in AI capabilities
  - **Cline**: VS Code extension with AI features
  - **Roo Code**: Web-based IDE with agent support

**Note for VS Code Users**: BMAD-METHOD assumes when you mention "VS Code" that you're using it with an AI-powered extension like GitHub Copilot, Cline, or Roo. Standard VS Code without AI capabilities cannot run BMAD agents. The installer includes built-in support for Cline and Roo.

**Verify Installation**:
- `.bmad-core/` folder created with all agents
- IDE-specific integration files created
- All agent commands/rules/modes available

**Remember**: At its core, BMAD-METHOD is about mastering and harnessing prompt engineering. Any IDE with AI agent support can use BMAD - the framework provides the structured prompts and workflows that make AI development effective

### Environment Selection Guide

**Use Web UI for**:
- Initial planning and documentation (PRD, architecture)
- Cost-effective document creation (especially with Gemini)
- Brainstorming and analysis phases
- Multi-agent consultation and planning

**Use IDE for**:
- Active development and coding
- File operations and project integration
- Document sharding and story management
- Implementation workflow (SM/Dev cycles)

**Cost-Saving Tip**: Create large documents (PRDs, architecture) in web UI, then copy to `docs/prd.md` and `docs/architecture.md` in your project before switching to IDE for development.

### IDE-Only Workflow Considerations

**Can you do everything in IDE?** Yes, but understand the tradeoffs:

**Pros of IDE-Only**:
- Single environment workflow
- Direct file operations from start
- No copy/paste between environments
- Immediate project integration

**Cons of IDE-Only**:
- Higher token costs for large document creation
- Smaller context windows (varies by IDE/model)
- May hit limits during planning phases
- Less cost-effective for brainstorming

**Using Web Agents in IDE**:
- **NOT RECOMMENDED**: Web agents (PM, Architect) have rich dependencies designed for large contexts
- **Why it matters**: Dev agents are kept lean to maximize coding context
- **The principle**: "Dev agents code, planning agents plan" - mixing breaks this optimization

**About bmad-master and bmad-orchestrator**:
- **bmad-master**: CAN do any task without switching agents, BUT...
- **Still use specialized agents for planning**: PM, Architect, and UX Expert have tuned personas that produce better results
- **Why specialization matters**: Each agent's personality and focus creates higher quality outputs
- **If using bmad-master/orchestrator**: Fine for planning phases, but...

**CRITICAL RULE for Development**:
- **ALWAYS use SM agent for story creation** - Never use bmad-master/orchestrator
- **ALWAYS use Dev agent for implementation** - Never use bmad-master/orchestrator
- **Why this matters**: SM and Dev agents are specifically optimized for the development workflow
- **No exceptions**: Even if using bmad-master for everything else, switch to SM â†’ Dev for implementation

**Best Practice for IDE-Only**:
1. Use PM/Architect/UX agents for planning (better than bmad-master)
2. Create documents directly in project
3. Shard immediately after creation
4. **MUST switch to SM agent** for story creation
5. **MUST switch to Dev agent** for implementation
6. Keep planning and coding in separate chat sessions

## Core Configuration (core-config.yml)

**New in V4**: The `bmad-core/core-config.yml` file is a critical innovation that enables BMAD to work seamlessly with any project structure, providing maximum flexibility and backwards compatibility.

### What is core-config.yml?

This configuration file acts as a map for BMAD agents, telling them exactly where to find your project documents and how they're structured. It enables:

- **Version Flexibility**: Work with V3, V4, or custom document structures
- **Custom Locations**: Define where your documents and shards live
- **Developer Context**: Specify which files the dev agent should always load
- **Debug Support**: Built-in logging for troubleshooting

### Key Configuration Areas

#### PRD Configuration
- **prdVersion**: Tells agents if PRD follows v3 or v4 conventions
- **prdSharded**: Whether epics are embedded (false) or in separate files (true)
- **prdShardedLocation**: Where to find sharded epic files
- **epicFilePattern**: Pattern for epic filenames (e.g., `epic-{n}*.md`)

#### Architecture Configuration
- **architectureVersion**: v3 (monolithic) or v4 (sharded)
- **architectureSharded**: Whether architecture is split into components
- **architectureShardedLocation**: Where sharded architecture files live

#### Developer Files
- **devLoadAlwaysFiles**: List of files the dev agent loads for every task
- **devDebugLog**: Where dev agent logs repeated failures
- **agentCoreDump**: Export location for chat conversations

### Why It Matters

1. **No Forced Migrations**: Keep your existing document structure
2. **Gradual Adoption**: Start with V3 and migrate to V4 at your pace
3. **Custom Workflows**: Configure BMAD to match your team's process
4. **Intelligent Agents**: Agents automatically adapt to your configuration

### Common Configurations

**Legacy V3 Project**:
```yaml
prdVersion: v3
prdSharded: false
architectureVersion: v3
architectureSharded: false
```

**V4 Optimized Project**:
```yaml
prdVersion: v4
prdSharded: true
prdShardedLocation: docs/prd
architectureVersion: v4
architectureSharded: true
architectureShardedLocation: docs/architecture
```

## Core Philosophy

### Vibe CEO'ing

You are the "Vibe CEO" - thinking like a CEO with unlimited resources and a singular vision. Your AI agents are your high-powered team, and your role is to:

- **Direct**: Provide clear instructions and objectives
- **Refine**: Iterate on outputs to achieve quality
- **Oversee**: Maintain strategic alignment across all agents

### Core Principles

1. **MAXIMIZE_AI_LEVERAGE**: Push the AI to deliver more. Challenge outputs and iterate.
2. **QUALITY_CONTROL**: You are the ultimate arbiter of quality. Review all outputs.
3. **STRATEGIC_OVERSIGHT**: Maintain the high-level vision and ensure alignment.
4. **ITERATIVE_REFINEMENT**: Expect to revisit steps. This is not a linear process.
5. **CLEAR_INSTRUCTIONS**: Precise requests lead to better outputs.
6. **DOCUMENTATION_IS_KEY**: Good inputs (briefs, PRDs) lead to good outputs.
7. **START_SMALL_SCALE_FAST**: Test concepts, then expand.
8. **EMBRACE_THE_CHAOS**: Adapt and overcome challenges.

### Key Workflow Principles

1. **Agent Specialization**: Each agent has specific expertise and responsibilities
2. **Clean Handoffs**: Always start fresh when switching between agents
3. **Status Tracking**: Maintain story statuses (Draft â†’ Approved â†’ InProgress â†’ Done)
4. **Iterative Development**: Complete one story before starting the next
5. **Documentation First**: Always start with solid PRD and architecture

### Agent Interaction Commands

#### IDE-Specific Syntax

**Agent Loading by IDE**:
- **Claude Code**: `/agent-name` (e.g., `/bmad-master`)
- **Cursor**: `@agent-name` (e.g., `@bmad-master`)
- **Windsurf**: `@agent-name` (e.g., `@bmad-master`)
- **Roo Code**: Select mode from mode selector (e.g., `bmad-bmad-master`)

**Chat Management Guidelines**:
- **Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf**: Start new chats when switching agents
- **Roo Code**: Switch modes within the same conversation

**Common Task Commands**:
- `*help` - Show available commands
- `*status` - Show current context/progress
- `*exit` - Exit the agent mode
- `*shard-doc docs/prd.md prd` - Shard PRD into manageable pieces
- `*shard-doc docs/architecture.md architecture` - Shard architecture document
- `*create` - Run create-next-story task (SM agent)

**In Web UI**:
```text
/pm create-doc prd
/architect review system design
/dev implement story 1.2
/help - Show available commands
/switch agent-name - Change active agent (if orchestrator available)
```

## Core Architecture

### System Overview

The BMAD-Method is built around a modular architecture centered on the `bmad-core` directory, which serves as the brain of the entire system. This design enables the framework to operate effectively in both IDE environments (like Cursor, VS Code) and web-based AI interfaces (like ChatGPT, Gemini).

### Key Architectural Components

#### 1. Agents (`bmad-core/agents/`)
- **Purpose**: Each markdown file defines a specialized AI agent for a specific Agile role (PM, Dev, Architect, etc.)
- **Structure**: Contains YAML headers specifying the agent's persona, capabilities, and dependencies
- **Dependencies**: Lists of tasks, templates, checklists, and data files the agent can use
- **Startup Instructions**: Can load project-specific documentation for immediate context

#### 2. Agent Teams (`bmad-core/agent-teams/`)
- **Purpose**: Define collections of agents bundled together for specific purposes
- **Examples**: `team-all.yml` (comprehensive bundle), `team-fullstack.yml` (full-stack development)
- **Usage**: Creates pre-packaged contexts for web UI environments

#### 3. Workflows (`bmad-core/workflows/`)
- **Purpose**: YAML files defining prescribed sequences of steps for specific project types
- **Types**: Greenfield (new projects) and Brownfield (existing projects) for UI, service, and fullstack development
- **Structure**: Defines agent interactions, artifacts created, and transition conditions

#### 4. Reusable Resources
- **Templates** (`bmad-core/templates/`): Markdown templates for PRDs, architecture specs, user stories
- **Tasks** (`bmad-core/tasks/`): Instructions for specific repeatable actions like "shard-doc" or "create-next-story"
- **Checklists** (`bmad-core/checklists/`): Quality assurance checklists for validation and review
- **Data** (`bmad-core/data/`): Core knowledge base and technical preferences

### Dual Environment Architecture

#### IDE Environment

- Users interact directly with agent markdown files
- Agents can access all dependencies dynamically
- Supports real-time file operations and project integration
- Optimized for development workflow execution

#### Web UI Environment

- Uses pre-built bundles from `dist/teams` for stand alone 1 upload files for all agents and their assest with an orchestrating agent
- Single text files containing all agent dependencies are in `dist/agents/` - these are unnecessary unless you want to create a web agent that is only a single agent and not a team
- Created by the web-builder tool for upload to web interfaces
- Provides complete context in one package

### Template Processing System

BMAD employs a sophisticated template system with three key components:

1. **Template Format** (`utils/template-format.md`): Defines markup language for variable substitution and AI processing directives
2. **Document Creation** (`tasks/create-doc.md`): Orchestrates template selection and user interaction
3. **Advanced Elicitation** (`tasks/advanced-elicitation.md`): Provides interactive refinement through structured brainstorming

**Template Features**:

- **Self-contained**: Templates embed both output structure and processing instructions
- **Variable Substitution**: `{{placeholders}}` for dynamic content
- **AI Processing Directives**: `[[LLM: instructions]]` for AI-only processing
- **Interactive Refinement**: Built-in elicitation processes for quality improvement

### Technical Preferences Integration

The `technical-preferences.md` file serves as a persistent technical profile that:
- Ensures consistency across all agents and projects
- Eliminates repetitive technology specification
- Provides personalized recommendations aligned with user preferences
- Evolves over time with lessons learned

### Build and Delivery Process

The `web-builder.js` tool creates web-ready bundles by:
1. Reading agent or team definition files
2. Recursively resolving all dependencies
3. Concatenating content into single text files with clear separators
4. Outputting ready-to-upload bundles for web AI interfaces

This architecture enables seamless operation across environments while maintaining the rich, interconnected agent ecosystem that makes BMAD powerful.

## Complete Development Workflow

### Planning Phase (Web UI Recommended)

**Ideal for cost efficiency, especially with Gemini:**

1. **Optional Analysis**: `/analyst` - Market research, competitive analysis
2. **Project Brief**: Create foundation document (Analyst or user)
3. **PRD Creation**: `/pm create-doc prd` - Comprehensive product requirements
4. **Architecture Design**: `/architect create-doc architecture` - Technical foundation
5. **Validation & Alignment**: `/po` run master checklist to ensure document consistency
6. **Document Preparation**: Copy final documents to project as `docs/prd.md` and `docs/architecture.md`

#### Example Planning Prompts

**For PRD Creation**:
```text
"I want to build a [type] application that [core purpose].
Help me brainstorm features and create a comprehensive PRD."
```

**For Architecture Design**:
```text
"Based on this PRD, design a scalable technical architecture
that can handle [specific requirements]."
```

### Critical Transition: Web UI to IDE

**Once planning is complete, you MUST switch to IDE for development:**

- **Why**: Development workflow requires file operations, real-time project integration, and document sharding
- **Cost Benefit**: Web UI is more cost-effective for large document creation; IDE is optimized for development tasks
- **Required Files**: Ensure `docs/prd.md` and `docs/architecture.md` exist in your project

### IDE Development Workflow

**Prerequisites**: Planning documents must exist in `docs/` folder

1. **Document Sharding** (CRITICAL STEP): 
   - Documents created by PM/Architect (in Web or IDE) MUST be sharded for development
   - Two methods to shard:
     a) **Manual**: Drag `shard-doc` task + document file into chat
     b) **Agent**: Ask `@bmad-master` or `@po` to shard documents
   - Shards `docs/prd.md` â†’ `docs/prd/` folder
   - Shards `docs/architecture.md` â†’ `docs/architecture/` folder
   - **WARNING**: Do NOT shard in Web UI - copying many small files is painful!

2. **Verify Sharded Content**:
   - At least one `epic-n.md` file in `docs/prd/` with stories in development order
   - Source tree document and coding standards for dev agent reference
   - Sharded docs for SM agent story creation

**Resulting Folder Structure**:
- `docs/prd/` - Broken down PRD sections
- `docs/architecture/` - Broken down architecture sections
- `docs/stories/` - Generated user stories

3. **Development Cycle** (Sequential, one story at a time):

   **CRITICAL CONTEXT MANAGEMENT**:
   - **Context windows matter!** Always use fresh, clean context windows
   - **Model selection matters!** Use most powerful thinking model for SM story creation
   - **ALWAYS start new chat between SM, Dev, and QA work**

   **Step 1 - Story Creation**: 
   - **NEW CLEAN CHAT** â†’ Select powerful model â†’ `@sm` â†’ `*create`
   - SM executes create-next-story task
   - Review generated story in `docs/stories/`
   - Update status from "Draft" to "Approved"
   
   **Step 2 - Story Implementation**: 
   - **NEW CLEAN CHAT** â†’ `@dev`
   - Agent asks which story to implement
   - Include story file content to save dev agent lookup time
   - Dev follows tasks/subtasks, marking completion
   - Dev maintains File List of all changes
   - Dev marks story as "Review" when complete with all tests passing
   
   **Step 3 - Senior QA Review**:
   - **NEW CLEAN CHAT** â†’ `@qa` â†’ execute review-story task
   - QA performs senior developer code review
   - QA can refactor and improve code directly
   - QA appends results to story's QA Results section
   - If approved: Status â†’ "Done"
   - If changes needed: Status stays "Review" with unchecked items for dev
   
   **Step 4 - Repeat**: Continue SM â†’ Dev â†’ QA cycle until all epic stories complete

**Important**: Only 1 story in progress at a time, worked sequentially until all epic stories complete.

### Status Tracking Workflow

Stories progress through defined statuses:
- **Draft** â†’ **Approved** â†’ **InProgress** â†’ **Done**

Each status change requires user verification and approval before proceeding.

### Workflow Types

#### Greenfield Development
- Business analysis and market research
- Product requirements and feature definition  
- System architecture and design
- Development execution
- Testing and deployment

#### Brownfield Enhancement (Existing Projects)

**Key Concept**: Brownfield development requires generating good documentation for agents to understand your existing project.

**Recommended Approach**:
1. **Analysis Phase**: Use Gemini Web or AI Studio with their 1M+ context windows
2. **Document Generation**: Ask Architect agent to analyze your project and run `document-project` task
3. **PRD Creation**: Even brownfield projects typically need a PRD unless:
   - Very small, focused changes
   - Using `brownfield-create-epic` for single epic without full PRD
4. **Architecture Assessment**: Use brownfield-specific templates for complex enhancements

**Brownfield Templates Available**:
- `brownfield-prd-tmpl.md`: For substantial enhancements requiring multiple stories
- `brownfield-architecture-tmpl.md`: For complex changes impacting system architecture
- Both templates emphasize compatibility and integration with existing systems

**When to Skip PRD**:
- For focused, single-epic work, use `brownfield-create-epic` task with detailed guidance
- For one-off stories without larger context
- Note: These tasks will evolve to require some documentation (potentially from `document-project`)

## Document Creation Best Practices

### Required File Naming for Framework Integration

- `docs/prd.md` - Product Requirements Document
- `docs/architecture.md` - System Architecture Document

**Why These Names Matter**:
- Agents automatically reference these files during development
- Sharding tasks expect these specific filenames
- Workflow automation depends on standard naming

### Cost-Effective Document Creation Workflow

**Recommended for Large Documents (PRD, Architecture):**

1. **Use Web UI**: Create documents in web interface for cost efficiency
2. **Copy Final Output**: Save complete markdown to your project
3. **Standard Names**: Save as `docs/prd.md` and `docs/architecture.md`
4. **Switch to IDE**: Use IDE agents for development and smaller documents

### Document Sharding

Templates with Level 2 headings (`##`) can be automatically sharded:

**Original PRD**:
```markdown
## Goals and Background Context
## Requirements  
## User Interface Design Goals
## Success Metrics
```

**After Sharding**:
- `docs/prd/goals-and-background-context.md`
- `docs/prd/requirements.md`
- `docs/prd/user-interface-design-goals.md`
- `docs/prd/success-metrics.md`

Use the `shard-doc` task or `@kayvan/markdown-tree-parser` tool for automatic sharding.

## Usage Patterns and Best Practices

==================== START: utils#template-format ====================
# Template Format Conventions

Templates in the BMAD method use standardized markup for AI processing. These conventions ensure consistent document generation.

## Template Markup Elements

- **{{placeholders}}**: Variables to be replaced with actual content
- **[[LLM: instructions]]**: Internal processing instructions for AI agents (never shown to users)
- **REPEAT** sections: Content blocks that may be repeated as needed
- **^^CONDITION^^** blocks: Conditional content included only if criteria are met
- **@{examples}**: Example content for guidance (never output to users)

## Processing Rules

- Replace all {{placeholders}} with project-specific content
- Execute all [[LLM: instructions]] internally without showing users
- Process conditional and repeat blocks as specified
- Use examples for guidance but never include them in final output
- Present only clean, formatted content to users

## Critical Guidelines

- **NEVER display template markup, LLM instructions, or examples to users**
- Template elements are for AI processing only
- Focus on faithful template execution and clean output
- All template-specific instructions are embedded within templates
