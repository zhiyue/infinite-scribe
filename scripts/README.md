```

#### `remote-logs.sh`
View logs from services running on the development server.

```bash
# View all logs (last 100 lines)
./scripts/monitoring/remote-logs.sh
# Or using pnpm
pnpm logs:remote

# Follow specific service logs
./scripts/monitoring/remote-logs.sh -f postgres
pnpm logs:remote -- -f postgres

# View last 50 lines of Kafka logs
./scripts/monitoring/remote-logs.sh -n 50 kafka
pnpm logs:remote -- -n 50 kafka

# Get help
./scripts/monitoring/remote-logs.sh --help
```

#### `backup-dev-data.sh`
Create a complete backup of all development data.

```bash
# Create backup (saved to ./backups/)
./scripts/monitoring/backup-dev-data.sh
# Or using pnpm
pnpm backup:dev

# Backup with custom server
DEV_SERVER=your.server.ip ./scripts/monitoring/backup-dev-data.sh
```

Backs up:
- PostgreSQL databases (all)
- Redis data
- Neo4j graph database
- MinIO object storage (novels bucket)
- Environment configuration files

### Backend Scripts (`../apps/backend/scripts/`)
Backend-specific scripts for running services and utilities.

#### API Gateway Startup Scripts
Located in `apps/backend/scripts/`:

- **`run-api-gateway-simple.sh`**: Simple startup without external service checks
  ```bash
  ./apps/backend/scripts/run-api-gateway-simple.sh
  # Or using pnpm
  pnpm backend:api:simple
  ```

- **`run-api-gateway-local.sh`**: Local development with `.env.local` configuration
  ```bash
  ./apps/backend/scripts/run-api-gateway-local.sh
  # Or using pnpm
  pnpm backend:api:local
  ```

- **`run-api-gateway-dev.sh`**: Development mode connecting to remote services (192.168.2.201)
  ```bash
  ./apps/backend/scripts/run-api-gateway-dev.sh
  # Or using pnpm
  pnpm backend:api:dev
  ```

See `apps/backend/scripts/README_API_GATEWAY.md` for detailed documentation.

### Utilities (`utils/`)
Utility scripts for migrations and miscellaneous tasks.

#### `migrate-env-structure.sh`
Migrate from single `.env` file to layered environment structure.

```bash
./scripts/utils/migrate-env-structure.sh
```

## üöÄ Quick Start Commands

For convenience, most scripts are also available as pnpm commands:

```bash
# Development setup
pnpm setup:dev              # Run setup-dev.sh
pnpm setup:pre-commit       # Run setup-pre-commit.sh

# Testing
pnpm test                    # Run tests
pnpm test:structure          # Test project structure

# Infrastructure management
pnpm infra:up                # Start all services locally
pnpm infra:down              # Stop all services
pnpm infra:deploy            # Deploy to dev server
pnpm check:services          # Check service health

# Monitoring
pnpm logs:remote             # View remote logs
pnpm backup:dev              # Backup development data
```

## Environment Variables

All deployment and monitoring scripts support these environment variables:

- `DEV_SERVER`: Target server IP (default: 192.168.2.201)
- `TEST_MACHINE_IP`: Test server IP (default: 192.168.2.202)
- `DEV_USER`: SSH user (default: zhiyue)

## Requirements

- SSH access to development/test servers
- Docker and Docker Compose on target servers
- Node.js for health check scripts
- Python 3.11+ with uv for development scripts
- Proper environment files (.env.infrastructure, .env.backend, etc.)

## Troubleshooting

### SSH Connection Failed
- Ensure you have SSH key access to the target server
- Check network connectivity
- Verify SSH user has necessary permissions

### Service Health Checks Fail
- Run `pnpm infra:up` to start services
- Check individual service logs with `pnpm logs:remote -- [service-name]`
- Verify environment variables in `.env.infrastructure`

### Test Failures
- For unit tests: Check Python environment and dependencies
- For integration tests: Ensure test services are running on test server
- Use `--remote` flag for pre-deployed services or `--docker-host` for isolated testing

### Development Environment Issues
- Run `./scripts/development/setup-dev.sh` to reset environment
- Verify Ruff configuration with `./scripts/development/verify-ruff.sh`
- Check pre-commit hooks with `pre-commit run --all-files`
